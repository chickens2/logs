Jan 01 23:22:31 <derram>	well, disney
Jan 01 23:23:08 <derram>	I'm surprised they even let it come back for a second season
Jan 01 23:23:16 <Barbaloot>	I think it's nice all my favorite shows start up again one month after the other though
Jan 01 23:23:25 <Barbaloot>	Adventure Time in January
Jan 01 23:23:32 <Barbaloot>	Gravity Falls in February
Jan 01 23:23:37 <Barbaloot>	Rick and Morty in March I think
Jan 01 23:23:51 <derram>	march is so far away, though ;-;
Jan 01 23:23:58 <Saltbearer>	Ponies in April
Jan 01 23:24:07 <Barbaloot>	Yeah. Hate waiting so long for perfection
Jan 01 23:24:09 <Saltbearer>	Firefly in May

Jan 01 23:25:37 <derram>	actually, I would hate to see korra come back
Jan 01 23:25:39 <Saltbearer>	Darkwing Duck tomorrow
Jan 01 23:25:41 <Barbaloot>	So it's Adventure Time -> Gravity Falls -> Rick and Morty -> MLP -> Red vs. blue
Jan 01 23:25:43 <Barbaloot>	I can dig that
Jan 01 23:25:48 <derram>	the way that show was going, they'd be airing the storyboards
Jan 01 23:29:10 <Barbaloot>	Ahh, wait
Jan 01 23:29:15 <Barbaloot>	Rick and Morty comes back in Summer
Jan 01 23:29:20 <Barbaloot>	hnnnnnnggg can't wait that long
Jan 01 23:29:25 <Barbaloot>	I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG
Jan 01 23:30:07 <Barbaloot>	Rick and Morty comic book?
Jan 01 23:30:14 <Barbaloot>	That'll be interesting
Jan 01 23:30:28 <Barbaloot>	It seems like the new fad is to make comic books based on Cartoons
Jan 01 23:30:37 <Barbaloot>	and it seems to be working pretty well
Jan 01 23:30:47 <derram>	I dunno, the voices are pretty important
Jan 01 23:31:02 <Barbaloot>	That's true, but if Brian Jaques ever taught me anything
Jan 01 23:31:15 <Barbaloot>	it's that you can still make a distinct voice come through with text

Feb 17 05:34:00 <Barbaloot>	IT WAS SHIT
Feb 17 05:34:03 <Barbaloot>	LIKE THE REST OF THE SHOW
Feb 17 05:34:11 <Barbaloot>	(It was good I loved it)
Feb 17 05:34:20 <snark>	haha
Feb 17 05:34:37 <snark>	I liked it a lot. Worth the wait, which I sort of don't feel was the case for the previous two
Feb 17 05:34:50 <snark>	like, they were fine, but they didn't really live up to weeks worth of hype the way this one did
Feb 17 05:34:50 <Barbaloot>	Well I just started watching
Feb 17 05:34:57 <Barbaloot>	so Love God came out right when I startedf
Feb 17 05:35:05 <Barbaloot>	Sooo this is the only wait for me so far
Feb 17 05:35:10 <snark>	oh, nice
Feb 17 05:35:17 <Barbaloot>	That's always the best
Feb 17 05:35:23 <Barbaloot>	but then every other wait is new to you
Feb 17 05:37:25 <snark>	this series has the weirdest schedule :\
Feb 17 05:37:31 <snark>	still, only 3 weeks until the next episode!
Feb 17 05:37:58 <Barbaloot>	Speaking of that
Feb 17 05:37:59 <snark>	most shows you just have the off-season, but with this one it's sort of always the off-season, with occasional spikes of seasonalness
Feb 17 05:38:03 <Barbaloot>	21 days to next episode
Feb 17 05:38:09 <Barbaloot>	21 hours until everybody dies
Feb 17 05:38:19 <Barbaloot>	THERE IS A CONNECTION I FEEL
Feb 17 05:38:23 <snark>	haha
Feb 17 05:38:46 <snark>	I think it's probably coincidence. They just needed a nice number less than 24, and probably didn't even know the airing schedule at the time
Feb 17 05:39:34 <snark>	I haven't seen anyone think about exactly what time of day that corresponds to. Three hours earlier, and that was mid to late evening I think, so maybe around sunset?
Feb 17 05:39:48 <snark>	Seems about right and would be a good time for ominous things to happen
Feb 17 05:39:51 <Barbaloot>	The sky will turn red
Feb 17 05:39:56 <Barbaloot>	and then stay that way forever
