Mar 09 21:46:44 <BOOKERCATCH_s>	explain
Mar 09 21:46:47 <J-Brony>	Can't run two of the new design 
Mar 09 21:46:53 <J-Brony>	Going back to the old
Mar 09 21:47:07 <BOOKERCATCH_s>	explain further
Mar 09 21:47:07 <Scix_s>	what?
Mar 09 21:47:23 <Scix_s>	also, derram isnt a mod anymore :/
Mar 09 21:47:31 <Scix_s>	how long has that been?
Mar 09 21:47:34 <J-Brony>	today
Mar 09 21:47:42 <BOOKERCATCH_s>	for what reason?
Mar 09 21:48:22 <BOOKERCATCH_s>	this looks a lot like some total bullshit
Mar 09 21:48:30 <AttackTheMoon>	RIOT
Mar 09 21:48:41 <J-Brony>	Andy is no longer a mod in chat either
Mar 09 21:48:56 <BOOKERCATCH_s>	who gives a shit
Mar 09 21:49:01 <theclinger>	This is the chat network that is officially associated with /r/comeinside and /r/mylittleandysonic1
Mar 09 21:49:01 <RariBot>	http://reddit.com/r/comeinside+mylittleandysonic1
Mar 09 21:49:14 <BOOKERCATCH_s>	bullshit
Mar 09 21:49:26 <Vidja>	Nope.
Mar 09 21:49:29 <Vidja>	Is true.
Mar 09 21:49:51 <BOOKERCATCH_s>	that is a terrible description of what has occured
Mar 09 21:50:07 <theclinger>	It's the literal discription of what has occured.
Mar 09 21:50:12 <Scix_s>	Then what happened, and why did you do this while derram was gone?
Mar 09 21:50:15 <Vidja>	What would you like for us to say?
Mar 09 21:50:18 <Scix_s>	or without informing him?
Mar 09 21:50:41 <theclinger>	He said that he was completely unwilling to work with us.
Mar 09 21:50:52 <BOOKERCATCH_s>	so you shouldn't have fucking worked around him
Mar 09 21:52:01 <BOOKERCATCH_s>	Take your time.
Mar 09 21:52:30 *	Domino (webchat@no-j2q.4qt.g34bqk.IP) has joined

Mar 09 21:52:44 <EvilHom3r>	the whole thing was completely pointless
Mar 09 21:52:47 <Domino>	What the fucktoozle, comroozles?
Mar 09 21:52:52 <BOOKERCATCH_s>	yeah
Mar 09 21:53:01 <Domino>	Who's idea was it to merge chats?
Mar 09 21:53:01 <BOOKERCATCH_s>	it was stupid, i was always against this
Mar 09 21:53:10 <BOOKERCATCH_s>	no one thought this would work out best
Mar 09 21:53:13 <Scix_s>	most of CI was against it IIRC
Mar 09 21:53:19 <EvilHom3r>	the same people from CI who wanted to stay away from mlas1 will go to whatever derram makes next
Mar 09 21:53:20 <BOOKERCATCH_s>	it's bullshit
Mar 09 21:53:34 <EvilHom3r>	and the people who were staying in both mlas1 and ci will stay here and maybe stay in derram's whatever
Mar 09 21:53:34 *	Domino has quit (Quit: Web client closed)
Mar 09 21:53:37 <EvilHom3r>	and nothing will change
Mar 09 21:54:28 <Scix_s>	yeah, thats been broken

Mar 09 21:55:49 <BOOKERCATCH_s>	that.
Mar 09 21:57:06 <EvilHom3r>	this is why I told everyone to stay in gabe's irc
Mar 09 21:57:13 <EvilHom3r>	and ignore whatever andy and derram were doing
Mar 09 21:57:18 <EvilHom3r>	and everything would've been good
Mar 09 21:57:53 <Esplin>	fuck
Mar 09 21:58:06 <Esplin>	I can't stop vomitting. now it is just bile
Mar 09 21:58:27 <terra>	lovely

Mar 09 22:08:07 <S2>	derram: yeah
Mar 09 22:08:07 <S2>	Scix: IF people in CI wanted to talk to MLAS people, they could go to MLAS
Mar 09 22:08:21 <S2>	derram: except all the people from our side that wasn't
Mar 09 22:08:23 <terra>	i said that i would appriciate it if the servers were merged
Mar 09 22:08:25 <S2>	Scix: J, you all completely misread that survey.
Mar 09 22:08:30 <terra>	not the domain forcibly seized
Mar 09 22:08:35 <S2>	derram: and the fact that you people had been feeding your chat bullshit about me
Mar 09 22:09:01 <J-Brony>	>forcibly seized
Mar 09 22:09:06 <S2>	derram: swift, if you didn't explicity say 'no' they counted it as a yes

Mar 09 22:09:10 <J-Brony>	By the owner of the domain?

Mar 09 22:09:41 <S2>	BOOKERCATCH: it was Derram's community, he did enough to deserve more say in the matter
Mar 09 22:09:47 <terra>	by the servers owned by the community owner
Mar 09 22:09:48 <eee>	This was dumb
Mar 09 22:09:58 <eee>	Holding DNS doesn't give you the rights to mutiny
Mar 09 22:10:08 <S2>	derram: trusted his ass

Mar 09 22:10:47 <eee>	It doesn't even matter who puts into it
Mar 09 22:10:54 <eee>	What I thought was really the dick move was not contacting lyra
Mar 09 22:10:59 <eee>	he owns the servers at the end of the dns
Mar 09 22:10:59 <terra>	^^
Mar 09 22:11:00 <S2>	BOOKERCATCH: glad to see you're only more miserible

Mar 09 22:11:11 <S2>	derram: I own them
Mar 09 22:11:13 <eee>	He shouldn't have his server's domains changed without forewarning and knowledge
Mar 09 22:11:14 <terra>	i was told "it was an oversight"
Mar 09 22:11:23 <S2>	derram: of course it was

Mar 09 22:23:03 <EvilHom3r>	~clop flared_penis
Mar 09 22:23:07 <eee>	eee: run it twice with some basic inter-process-communication glue. There, even if the steam library blows up you can solve that
Mar 09 22:23:13 <eee>	J-Brony: ^

Mar 09 22:24:00 <Echo>	but I have an hour and a half now to watch a 4 hour movie and write a report on it
Mar 09 22:24:05 <S2>	ddaᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗadd: but if you get rid of steam I'd have t use IRC
Mar 09 22:24:10 <Echo>	so I can't fix it right now
