**** BEGIN LOGGING AT Sat Nov 23 20:59:17 2013

Nov 23 20:59:17 *	Now talking on #modtalk
Nov 23 20:59:17 *	Topic for #modtalk is: STUFF
Nov 23 20:59:17 *	Topic for #modtalk set by herabek!herabear@ci-12e.v7e.dc4pa0.IP (Sat Nov 23 16:00:16 2013)
Nov 23 20:59:34 <Herabek>	you responded to the modmail, so alls good 
Nov 23 21:00:51 <flare>	I think this is a good idea
Nov 23 21:01:10 <Herabek>	yay
Nov 23 22:31:36 *	derram (derram@Pinkie.Pie) has joined
Nov 23 23:35:49 <Herabek>	Woo!
Nov 23 23:44:48 <derram>	seriously though
Nov 23 23:45:40 <derram>	They told me they couldn't do anything about social harassing Esplin and Ninka because it was over PM and not in the main channel, then they banned me from the server for PMing someone a link to our sub
Nov 23 23:46:32 <Herabek>	This is the way to maybe get them less aggressive towards you.
Nov 23 23:47:25 <derram>	right 
Nov 23 23:48:44 <derram>	or they just want to use us for this 
Nov 23 23:49:04 <Herabek>	As much as it could benefit them, it can only benefit us more.
Nov 23 23:49:38 <RisenLM>	How could one possibly utilize a secret santa for personal gain, outside of the obvious gift exchange?
Nov 23 23:50:21 <derram>	fucked if I know
Nov 23 23:50:27 <derram>	but every time
Nov 23 23:50:32 <derram>	I get fucked
Nov 23 23:51:13 <derram>	Has coggler been back since Esplin
Nov 23 23:51:16 <derram>	s post?
Nov 23 23:51:57 <Herabek>	yes
Nov 23 23:52:07 <Herabek>	She actually left because I was asking her about it.
Nov 23 23:56:04 <derram>	I don't trust them
Nov 23 23:56:10 <derram>	Andy does nothing but lie
Nov 23 23:56:20 <derram>	"temporary ban"
Nov 23 23:56:27 <derram>	almost 2 months ago
Nov 23 23:57:56 <derram>	http://i.imgur.com/jNA1QQY.png
Nov 23 23:58:07 <derram>	and when they fuck me over
Nov 23 23:58:11 <derram>	nothing happens 
Nov 23 23:58:14 <derram>	no one says shit
Nov 23 23:58:26 <derram>	so why should I trust the, not to fuck me over yet again?
Nov 23 23:59:31 <Herabek>	Because you're not really risking anything here
Nov 24 00:01:20 <derram>	could be a way for them to try and steal the chat 
Nov 24 00:02:18 <derram>	and I'm betting that our name won't be mentioned in the post 
Nov 24 00:02:26 <RisenLM>	I can't even begin to grasp how that makes sense
Nov 24 00:02:29 <derram>	it'll be "the mla1 secret santa"
Nov 24 00:02:41 <derram>	well, like I said
Nov 24 00:02:46 <derram>	they keep fucking me over
Nov 24 00:02:59 <derram>	they lie about me over and over 
Nov 24 00:03:21 <derram>	I defend myself and they call it "starting drama"
Nov 24 00:03:29 <derram>	someone else slanders me and it's fine
Nov 24 00:03:48 <derram>	I don't want to help them with shit
Nov 24 00:04:00 <derram>	helping them is the reason we're in this mess
Nov 24 00:04:08 <derram>	should'a started my own thing a long time ago 
Nov 24 00:04:23 <derram>	when they dropped everything in my lap and fucking walked away
Nov 24 00:04:49 <RisenLM>	So don't. Let someone else handle it. It's only helping your userbase, but fuck those guys. I don't see how it even got back to this. What does it have to do with anything?
Nov 24 00:05:23 <derram>	because every time I interact with them I get fucked
Nov 24 00:05:36 <derram>	and all anyone ever has to say is "ah well, that sucks"
Nov 24 00:05:51 <RisenLM>	What do you want, a small claims court case?
Nov 24 00:05:51 <derram>	I don't want to deal with whatever the fuck it is they're planning
Nov 24 00:06:28 <derram>	I want to fix this shit
Nov 24 00:06:34 <derram>	but it's impossible 
Nov 24 00:06:51 <derram>	I can't trust that side for shit anymore
Nov 24 00:07:02 <derram>	They accused me of lying to my friends
Nov 24 00:07:08 <derram>	over 30 fucking people 
Nov 24 00:07:42 <derram>	Do you even remember Andy's side of the story?
Nov 24 00:07:55 <derram>	How he told everyone I was the one who was hard to work with?
Nov 24 00:08:15 <derram>	when all he could respond with was "I don't give a fuck, you handle it"
Nov 24 00:08:29 <derram>	When I had to find out about new rules on the sub
Nov 24 00:08:33 <RisenLM>	I stopped caring after it went on forever.
Nov 24 00:08:40 <derram>	When I had to find out I was being demodded on the sub
Nov 24 00:08:46 <derram>	of course
Nov 24 00:08:51 <derram>	you didn't lose anything
Nov 24 00:08:57 <derram>	I lost friends
Nov 24 00:09:13 <RisenLM>	You actively made decisions that lead to these results.
Nov 24 00:09:13 <derram>	because I wouldn't fucking sit there with Hom3r and Social 
Nov 24 00:09:33 <derram>	I left
Nov 24 00:09:37 <derram>	that's all I did
Nov 24 00:09:44 <derram>	I didn't call for an exodus 
Nov 24 00:09:58 <derram>	I didn't tell anyone they couldn't post to mlas1 or join their chat
Nov 24 00:10:08 <derram>	but they treated me like complete shit
Nov 24 00:10:16 <derram>	lied about the entire fucking thing
Nov 24 00:10:34 <RisenLM>	It's not lying if the party in question is convinced they're right.
Nov 24 00:10:53 <derram>	no, it's still slander
Nov 24 00:12:02 <derram>	it doesn't fucking matter
Nov 24 00:12:20 <derram>	http://np.reddit.com/r/mylittleandysonic1/comments/1r7y1f/httpiimgurcomcahxksagif/cdkvjms
Nov 24 00:12:22 <derram>	people lie 
Nov 24 00:12:31 <derram>	those lies are passed off over and over as truth
Nov 24 00:12:36 <derram>	no one says shit
Nov 24 00:12:39 <derram>	do whatever
Nov 24 00:12:52 <RisenLM>	Slander is a fabricated attack on one's character with the sole purpose of damaging their repution, and it only applies verbally, so this would be libel. However, if it isn't actually fabricated i.e. heartfelt belief that they are correct, then all it boils down to is one person's word against another.
Nov 24 00:13:15 <derram>	They accused me of harassment 
Nov 24 00:13:30 <derram>	while saying Social "had some bad words" with Esplin
Nov 24 00:13:43 <derram>	Over and over again 
Nov 24 00:13:59 <derram>	and fucking luna
Nov 24 00:14:11 <derram>	I had to try for fucking months to drag his ass into the chat
Nov 24 00:14:13 <RisenLM>	Why are you fighting other people's battles?
Nov 24 00:14:14 <derram>	and now 
Nov 24 00:14:27 <derram>	because they were my friends 
Nov 24 00:14:34 <derram>	And social chased them away 
Nov 24 00:14:39 <derram>	because they were sitting in my chat too
Nov 24 00:14:43 <derram>	AND GUESS WHAT
Nov 24 00:14:48 <derram>	NO ONE TOLD HIM SHIT ABOUT IT!
Nov 24 00:14:50 <derram>	HA!
Nov 24 00:14:50 <RisenLM>	I don't even understand this chronology anymore
Nov 24 00:15:07 <derram>	http://np.reddit.com/r/mylittleandysonic1/comments/1r7y1f/httpiimgurcomcahxksagif/cdlibqf
Nov 24 00:15:28 <derram>	he pretended to be my friend 
Nov 24 00:15:32 <derram>	because I was a mod of that sub
Nov 24 00:16:01 <derram>	and we only get mentioned in disdan
Nov 24 00:16:18 <derram>	2 of the mods actually post to the sub
Nov 24 00:16:20 <RisenLM>	Or he was legitimately your friend until you wouldn't agree to do something when you both believed you were in the right.
Nov 24 00:16:28 <derram>	really
Nov 24 00:16:33 <derram>	you're cutting him slack?
Nov 24 00:16:39 <derram>	all I did was fucking leave 
Nov 24 00:16:47 <derram>	would you like the chat log between us?
Nov 24 00:16:52 <RisenLM>	I was there, thanks.
Nov 24 00:16:59 <derram>	it was in pm
Nov 24 00:17:06 <RisenLM>	I got the gist.
Nov 24 00:17:09 <derram>	right
Nov 24 00:17:18 <derram>	anyway 
Nov 24 00:17:21 <derram>	whatever 
Nov 24 00:17:24 <derram>	I don't care
Nov 24 00:17:28 <RisenLM>	For the record, I agreed with you.
Nov 24 00:17:36 <derram>	they'll fuck us over, none of you will say anything about it 
Nov 24 00:17:42 <derram>	I'll be pissed off all over again
Nov 24 00:17:44 <RisenLM>	Because what does that even constitute?
Nov 24 00:17:57 <derram>	how the fuck should I know
Nov 24 00:18:07 <RisenLM>	Most everyone else has a completely different view of being screwed, apparently.
Nov 24 00:18:10 <derram>	I really didn't think speedy would demod me from mlas1animotes
Nov 24 00:18:19 <derram>	not for doing the same shit he was doing
Nov 24 00:18:31 <derram>	I really didn't think I would never have anyone to defend nme
Nov 24 00:18:35 <derram>	but
Nov 24 00:18:38 <derram>	that sub
Nov 24 00:18:43 <RisenLM>	Because no one in the world is blatantly hypocritical and won't acknowledge it
Nov 24 00:18:48 <derram>	I was important because of that sub
Nov 24 00:19:27 <derram>	I don't know what that's supposed to mean
Nov 24 00:19:54 <derram>	I'd love to know what hypocrisy I've commited
Nov 24 00:20:05 <RisenLM>	I'm talking about Speedy. The thing you literally just brought up.
Nov 24 00:20:45 <derram>	they can do whatever they want 
Nov 24 00:20:56 <derram>	no one will call them on it 
Nov 24 00:21:09 <derram>	I'm the asshole who was impossible to work with and harassed users 
Nov 24 00:21:27 <derram>	now I get downvoted everywhere
Nov 24 00:21:41 <derram>	because no one wanted to get mixed up in the drama for my sake
Nov 24 00:21:46 <derram>	so now
Nov 24 00:22:01 <derram>	They're asking if we want to participate with them in something 
Nov 24 00:22:06 <RisenLM>	Nobody on the outside sees you as some antihero to be shamed. No one even knows what you did, what happened, or why.
Nov 24 00:22:13 <derram>	and everything up to this point has lead with me getting fucked
Nov 24 00:22:23 <derram>	and you expect me to not hink I'm gonna get fucked again?
Nov 24 00:22:40 <derram>	tell that to the people downvoting everything I do 
Nov 24 00:22:53 <RisenLM>	The only reason you get downvoted is because it looks objectively like you trying to start something 
Nov 24 00:22:54 <derram>	tell that to the people who skip over me with the upvotes
Nov 24 00:23:24 <derram>	honestly, I don't even wanna look at reddit most of the time 
Nov 24 00:23:43 <derram>	full of lying hypocritical assholes who only care about popularity 
Nov 24 00:24:21 <derram>	and remember Herb
Nov 24 00:24:28 <derram>	http://i.imgur.com/gXXRxvv.pnghow that went
Nov 24 00:24:32 <derram>	http://i.imgur.com/gXXRxvv.png
Nov 24 00:24:34 <RisenLM>	If literally anyone came in raving about "what actually happened" in any given situation about anything, people are going to groan and look away, because they weren't involved. Since you can't do that on the internet, and there's a voting system, this is the end result.
Nov 24 00:24:59 <derram>	maybe if someone who was there 
Nov 24 00:25:02 <derram>	said something 
Nov 24 00:25:10 <derram>	instead of making a snide ass comment with an emote
Nov 24 00:25:17 <derram>	but
Nov 24 00:25:21 <RisenLM>	All that would happen is they'd get downvoted too for contributing to what looks like starting shit
Nov 24 00:25:22 <derram>	"don't wanna get mixed up in it"
Nov 24 00:25:29 <derram>	haha
Nov 24 00:25:35 <derram>	but the guy who posted it wasn't?
Nov 24 00:25:43 <RisenLM>	Posted what?
Nov 24 00:25:46 <derram>	the person insulting me was just having a laugh?
Nov 24 00:25:58 <derram>	but if I defend myself, it's drama?
Nov 24 00:26:00 <RisenLM>	At what point where you getting insulted in that thread?
Nov 24 00:26:13 <RisenLM>	At what point was CI getting called anything other than a place?
Nov 24 00:26:16 <derram>	there's been a few threads
Nov 24 00:26:26 <derram>	and the one esplin made
Nov 24 00:26:30 <derram>	he called it retarded
Nov 24 00:26:35 <derram>	Capt called it stupid 
Nov 24 00:26:42 <derram>	that entire thread was to bash CI
Nov 24 00:26:43 <RisenLM>	He called the stupid bullshit that lead to people splitting into factions retarded
Nov 24 00:26:48 <derram>	that's why it was allowed to remain
Nov 24 00:26:51 <RisenLM>	They're mad because people aren't together anymore
Nov 24 00:26:56 <RisenLM>	Don't you get it?
Nov 24 00:27:08 <derram>	what does it matter what I think
Nov 24 00:27:46 <derram>	Andy was right
Nov 24 00:27:55 <derram>	they can do whatever they want to me and no one will care
Nov 24 00:28:16 <derram>	just like no one cares that I'm still banned for shit that no one else was ever banned for 
Nov 24 00:28:21 <derram>	both on the chat and the sub
Nov 24 00:28:44 <derram>	Hom3r got a week long ban for trying to kill the fucking server
Nov 24 00:28:46 <RisenLM>	Because you aren't seeing the big picture. People aren't upset that it exist. They aren't calling it dumb. They're calling this pointless, unnecessary schism of people who liked each other dumb, because it was. There was no reason it had to happen if anyone could actually mediate and work things out. Now there's communities and certain people don't visit more than one, so the community is fragmented more than it needed to be. But it already happene
Nov 24 00:28:47 <RisenLM>	d, and all that's left is disappointment that it had to.
Nov 24 00:29:02 <derram>	And why is it my fault?
Nov 24 00:29:08 <RisenLM>	Nobody said it's your goddamn fault
Nov 24 00:29:19 <derram>	that sure is the way everyone acts
Nov 24 00:29:27 <RisenLM>	Nobody acts like that
Nov 24 00:29:38 <derram>	I figure, if it wasn't my fault 
Nov 24 00:29:45 <derram>	then when people say it is 
Nov 24 00:29:53 <derram>	other people would stand up and say "no, it's not"
Nov 24 00:30:00 <derram>	but they don't 
Nov 24 00:30:03 <RisenLM>	Fault and blame have never been discussed
Nov 24 00:30:12 <RisenLM>	There's nothing to refute because it's never brought up
Nov 24 00:30:14 <derram>	Andy blamed it all on me 
Nov 24 00:30:37 <RisenLM>	The only thing Andy said publically was that you aren't a mod now. 
Nov 24 00:30:38 <derram>	and that was the story that was passed around as truth
Nov 24 00:30:46 <derram>	because no one defended me 
Nov 24 00:30:54 <derram>	no one told me I needed to defend myself
Nov 24 00:30:55 <RisenLM>	Defended what? You weren't blamed!
Nov 24 00:31:00 <derram>	I just said I was
Nov 24 00:31:12 <RisenLM>	There was never an instance where the fault of anything fell on you outside of a private chat.
Nov 24 00:31:27 <RisenLM>	It's the exact reason why "what happened" is a question that constantly pops up
Nov 24 00:38:28 <derram>	http://np.reddit.com/r/mylittleandysonic1/comments/1j53py/itsybitsy_teenietiny_rant_whatchamacallit_about/cbb7q1m
Nov 24 00:38:35 <derram>	blamed it all on me
Nov 24 00:38:47 <derram>	my favorite part
Nov 24 00:39:17 <derram>	>I may do shit people don't like, but at the end of the day I'll turn around and say I fucked up.
Nov 24 00:39:36 <derram>	>While it pretty much goes to shit, I figure if people realize this kind of change is possible they will look more at what they are doing and change it.
Nov 24 00:39:58 <derram>	he's a lying sack of shit
Nov 24 00:40:07 <derram>	how can I trust him
Nov 24 00:40:16 <derram>	hell, I don't trust esplin anymore 
Nov 24 00:40:42 <RisenLM>	You know those things you did with taking down the CSS and changing the redirect to your own whims? Those are things you actually did, and were your fault, but you didn't own up to either. 
Nov 24 00:40:56 <derram>	Yeah, I did
Nov 24 00:41:08 <derram>	how is it fair that I do everything for that place
Nov 24 00:41:26 <derram>	but my opinion on moving the server doesn't matter?
Nov 24 00:41:50 <derram>	Like I said, I took down the css in protest
Nov 24 00:41:54 <RisenLM>	Life isn't fair. You know who else's opinion didn't matter? Fucking everyone. All of 3 people were involved in that.
Nov 24 00:42:10 <derram>	and that's what andy is counting on
Nov 24 00:42:16 <derram>	because ya know what
Nov 24 00:42:26 <derram>	he'll fuck us over with the santa thing
Nov 24 00:42:33 <derram>	and then we'll be having this conversation again
Nov 24 00:42:38 <derram>	and nothing will change
Nov 24 00:42:43 <derram>	so, yeah whatever 
Nov 24 00:42:45 <derram>	do it
Nov 24 00:43:11 <RisenLM>	It's a gift exchange. Nobody has control of people trading gifts. It's all 3rd party and basically impossible to ruin.
Nov 24 00:43:21 <derram>	yeah, 
Nov 24 00:43:22 <derram>	sure
Nov 24 00:43:26 <derram>	whatever
Nov 24 00:43:45 <RisenLM>	Being flippant about it doesn't give me a lot of encouragement.
Nov 24 00:44:11 <derram>	I'm sure one of them will be running the whole thing 
Nov 24 00:44:22 <derram>	hey, let social do it again
Nov 24 00:44:25 <derram>	totally not biased
Nov 24 00:44:29 <RisenLM>	Nobody is letting Social do it again.
Nov 24 00:44:47 <RisenLM>	If only for the simple fact that he is impossibly lazy.
Nov 24 00:45:03 <derram>	of course
Nov 24 00:45:06 <derram>	because, like I said
Nov 24 00:45:08 <derram>	only me 
Nov 24 00:46:09 <derram>	man
Nov 24 00:46:16 <derram>	so much shit they get away with over and over
Nov 24 00:46:25 <derram>	but I can't fucking link a subreddit on a private sub
Nov 24 00:47:00 <derram>	and 
Nov 24 00:47:12 <derram>	He refused to ever help 
Nov 24 00:47:34 <derram>	they ditched us for the plounge
Nov 24 00:47:39 <derram>	maybe that's why
Nov 24 00:47:45 <derram>	no one gives two shits about me
Nov 24 00:47:45 <RisenLM>	I don't understand these segues
Nov 24 00:47:49 <derram>	I was never apart of that
Nov 24 00:47:54 <derram>	a part
Nov 24 00:48:46 <derram>	well, now I'm sad all over again
Nov 24 00:49:18 <derram>	wonder how many people Luna stopped being friends with because they started going to the plounge instead of mlas1
Nov 24 00:50:01 <derram>	I still say we need to replace Esplin 
Nov 24 00:50:14 <derram>	he's made it clear he doesn't want anything to do with our sub
Nov 24 00:50:19 <derram>	and I don'
Nov 24 00:50:28 <derram>	t trust him having mod powers in the chat
Nov 24 00:51:29 <RisenLM>	Well you're exaggerating, because the guy's just depressed that people he likes won't be together, but obviously you won't listen to anything I say with any intent on considering it. 
Nov 24 00:51:53 <derram>	because I've considered all of this for 4 months now 
Nov 24 00:52:05 <derram>	comeinside is the only sub I browse 
Nov 24 00:52:11 <RisenLM>	From nothing but your own perspective.
Nov 24 00:52:23 <derram>	well, I've seen what Andy has said in public
Nov 24 00:52:45 <derram>	And, Esplin hasn't posted to the sub in months
Nov 24 00:53:00 <derram>	He considers posting to our sub an attack on mlas1 
Nov 24 00:53:15 <RisenLM>	To one person, that nobody else even remembers, or has the interest in finding.
Nov 24 00:53:16 <derram>	he posted to mlas1 saying he wants the chat back over there
Nov 24 00:53:32 <derram>	I'm still talking abut esplin
Nov 24 00:53:51 <RisenLM>	Is it illegal to want the chat back to where he used to enjoy it?
Nov 24 00:53:57 <derram>	no
Nov 24 00:54:05 <derram>	but why is he a mod if he wants to destroy us
Nov 24 00:54:18 <derram>	why is he a mod if he refuses to do anything for us
Nov 24 00:54:41 <RisenLM>	You're construing it as there being Place A and Place B and the only way for them to exist is if Place B is gone.
Nov 24 00:54:48 <RisenLM>	He wants there to just be Place AB.
Nov 24 00:55:03 <derram>	no, he said he wants everyone in the same place 
Nov 24 00:55:13 <derram>	meaning he wants the chat to be over there
Nov 24 00:55:18 <RisenLM>	No.
Nov 24 00:55:20 <RisenLM>	You're construing it.
Nov 24 00:55:28 <derram>	so
Nov 24 00:55:31 <derram>	instead of that 
Nov 24 00:55:37 <derram>	why not send people over here?
Nov 24 00:55:59 <RisenLM>	Because you know full well that not everyone would come.
Nov 24 00:56:00 <derram>	instead of calling the existence of our sub retarded
Nov 24 00:56:03 <derram>	why not promote us
Nov 24 00:56:12 <derram>	why?
Nov 24 00:56:26 <derram>	what is so intrinsically wrong about our sub?
Nov 24 00:56:39 <derram>	Andy doesn't like it
Nov 24 00:56:52 <RisenLM>	The fact that it was born under the pretext of splintering away.
Nov 24 00:57:22 <RisenLM>	People don't want people they like to leave.
Nov 24 00:57:43 <RisenLM>	You can't replace that feeling by just moving to somewhere else, because you're going to lose people along the way.
Nov 24 00:57:46 <derram>	so we're just wrong forever then
Nov 24 00:57:59 <RisenLM>	It's not about being "right" or "wrong"
Nov 24 00:58:29 <derram>	it has to be if people refuse to use a subreddit
Nov 24 00:58:35 <RisenLM>	It's the simple fact sense of comaradery that can't be reforged.
Nov 24 00:59:15 <RisenLM>	For Esplin specifically, I'd wager a lot on the fact that it just reminds him of people leaving.
Nov 24 00:59:43 <RisenLM>	not just now, not even 4 months ago, but everyone he was friends with who left the sub, the fandom, contact.
Nov 24 01:00:23 <RisenLM>	So he sticks to what he knows, because change just tears people apart.
Nov 24 01:00:48 <derram>	double standards 
Nov 24 01:01:00 <derram>	no other sub has this 
Nov 24 01:01:13 <derram>	if you wanna start truewtf, you're allowed to 
Nov 24 01:01:28 <derram>	no one says "omg, you're using the same initials"
Nov 24 01:01:48 <RisenLM>	Because WTF is just some catch-all subreddit for pictures that weird people out. It's not a real community.
Nov 24 01:01:48 <derram>	all I did was start a new place for myself
Nov 24 01:01:53 <derram>	and people followed
Nov 24 01:02:05 <derram>	not my fault that I was the only thing keeping their chat together
Nov 24 01:02:18 <derram>	and no one wanted to step up to fill my shoes
Nov 24 01:02:28 <derram>	I threw my life at that place
Nov 24 01:03:14 <derram>	no one else spends near as much time in the chat as I do 
Nov 24 01:03:28 <derram>	that's why theirs is falling apart 
Nov 24 01:03:29 <RisenLM>	You think there might be a reason for that?
Nov 24 01:03:43 <derram>	because I care about all this
Nov 24 01:04:05 <RisenLM>	It's an enormous investment, one that's practically unrealistic for most people because they have other responsibilities.
Nov 24 01:04:13 <derram>	at some point it stopped being "just a thing on the internet" and started being important
Nov 24 01:04:46 <derram>	and that is why they're suffering 
Nov 24 01:04:51 <RisenLM>	But that's just it. For most everyone it's still just a thing on the internet, albiet one they care about more than any arbitrary place.
Nov 24 01:04:51 <derram>	not because I started something new 
Nov 24 01:05:03 <derram>	but because one of the pillars that held them up is now gone
Nov 24 01:05:40 <derram>	and all they could do about it was lie 
Nov 24 01:05:43 <derram>	and cut us out
Nov 24 01:06:14 <RisenLM>	Or maybe no one else has come to a realization, and resort to blaming what they think is the problem?
Nov 24 01:06:22 <RisenLM>	People aren't black and white.
Nov 24 01:07:16 <derram>	no
Nov 24 01:07:19 <derram>	it's censorship
Nov 24 01:07:58 <derram>	andy lied, then removed all comments that contradicted him
Nov 24 01:08:12 <derram>	then allows posts that slander the sub
Nov 24 01:08:27 <RisenLM>	There's no fucking slander
Nov 24 01:08:38 <derram>	did you read that post I linked?
Nov 24 01:08:49 <derram>	he lied about the entire thing
Nov 24 01:09:01 <derram>	would you like me to go over it point by point?
Nov 24 01:09:08 <RisenLM>	The one that's old as shit and nobody else would have ever found? The one that's completely meaningless? The one written from one person's perspective and therefore only written as they believe?
Nov 24 01:09:32 <derram>	it's the official story 
Nov 24 01:09:41 <RisenLM>	There's no mod text on it
Nov 24 01:09:44 <RisenLM>	It's not put in the sidebar
Nov 24 01:09:44 <derram>	it's why myrandall thinks I'm the only one who left 
Nov 24 01:09:51 <RisenLM>	Nobody links it 
Nov 24 01:10:04 <derram>	I didn;t find it  until it was two days old 
Nov 24 01:10:11 <RisenLM>	Myrandall doesn't give 2 shits about what went down, and I know that because I asked.
Nov 24 01:10:12 <derram>	but
Nov 24 01:10:20 <derram>	that's where their info comes from 
Nov 24 01:10:32 <derram>	someone asks, "derram got mad and made a sub"
Nov 24 01:10:40 <derram>	because that's what Andy told them 
Nov 24 01:11:43 <RisenLM>	Do you want a mandatory re-education course so we can explain, in horribly-stupid detail, about why there's another sub, so they can care just as little and continue to spurn new things?
Nov 24 01:11:56 <derram>	http://i.imgur.com/gzjh1mM.png
Nov 24 01:12:18 <derram>	http://i.imgur.com/ykW5KAk.png
Nov 24 01:12:52 <derram>	nobody knows shit except Andy's lies
Nov 24 01:13:03 <derram>	because no one wanted to get involved
Nov 24 01:13:07 <RisenLM>	It's pointless plesantries. I tied explaining it before, and he explicity told me how little he cares. How little he even cares about that sub, except that he can get karma and a modium of entertainment from it.
Nov 24 01:13:27 <derram>	good 
Nov 24 01:13:34 <derram>	I hope it only attracts people like that now
Nov 24 01:14:02 <RisenLM>	Its always attracted people like that, maybe in smaller numbers.
Nov 24 01:14:05 <derram>	meanwhile 
Nov 24 01:14:11 <RisenLM>	s/always/for a long time
Nov 24 01:14:13 <derram>	people talk shit about it everywhere 
Nov 24 01:14:18 <derram>	well, CI
Nov 24 01:14:26 <derram>	but no one wants to advertise it anywhere
Nov 24 01:14:42 <derram>	no one wants to speak positively about it anywhere
Nov 24 01:14:42 <Herabek>	well that was a huge amount of text.
Nov 24 01:14:48 <derram>	\\4a
Nov 24 01:14:53 <RisenLM>	Because to advertise something you need to know what you're selling in the first place
Nov 24 01:15:59 <derram>	and/or care
Nov 24 01:19:46 <derram>	also, Herb was saying something about a survey for the sub's direction
Nov 24 01:19:56 <derram>	I'm sure it'll go all of nowhere
Nov 24 01:21:30 <derram>	honestly
Nov 24 01:21:39 <derram>	I'm getting tired of trying to prop the sub up
Nov 24 01:23:22 <RisenLM>	You think I don't care? It has nothing to with how much I do or do not care. It's about not wanting to put effort into recruiting some random new blood that will invariably fail to replace the people I liked. Maybe I just have no motivation to do that, and maybe I have things going on right now that take priority. Thus far, your idea for advertising is to try in vain to post on MLAS1 who probably just see it as trying to steal members because god f
Nov 24 01:23:22 <RisenLM>	orbid people go to multiple places, and to get all-too-squicked people from new Plounge. What do you want from the sub? A direction is necessary to get people to join, since you draw in those with similar tastes. Otherwise it's aimless.
Nov 24 01:25:22 <derram>	help
Nov 24 01:25:35 <derram>	I said I couldn't do it all alone
Nov 24 01:25:54 <derram>	Esplin promised to help
Nov 24 01:26:10 <derram>	but he turned around a week later
Nov 24 01:27:18 <RisenLM>	Esplin isn't exactly stable lately, so don't disparage him for not jumping on any opportunity to help out anyone. 
Nov 24 01:34:50 <derram>	it's been 4 months 
Nov 24 01:35:33 <RisenLM>	Probably a correlation.
Nov 24 01:36:21 <derram>	and if it is tearing him apart, all the more reason to remove him
Nov 24 01:36:40 <derram>	he also lied to me about a lot of stuff
Nov 24 01:37:37 <RisenLM>	Probably because you've been like the Inquisition to him?
Nov 24 01:38:05 <derram>	wut
Nov 24 01:38:47 <RisenLM>	http://www.reddit.com/r/CHART_BOT/comments/1nzhc3/edriss562/
Nov 24 01:41:04 <derram>	noticed he hadn't posted to the sub in a long time, so I posted there to confirm 
Nov 24 01:41:13 <derram>	if I tell you I'm gonna help 
Nov 24 01:41:31 <derram>	then I turn my back on you, I'd expect you to be a bit pived 
Nov 24 01:42:30 <RisenLM>	It'd be a minor inconvenience at worst. 
Nov 24 01:44:04 <derram>	oh yeah, there was also the frequent lying
Nov 24 01:44:24 <derram>	he'd PM me and ask how I was doing, so I'd tell him
Nov 24 01:44:41 <derram>	eventually we'd get to specific topics 
Nov 24 01:45:00 <derram>	he'd tell me one thing only for me to find out the exact opposite the next day
Nov 24 01:45:07 <derram>	like,before he deleted his account
Nov 24 01:45:18 <derram>	he told me he was getting tired of being Esplin
Nov 24 01:45:25 <RisenLM>	again, Inquisition
Nov 24 01:45:49 <derram>	how is it an inquisition if he's the one who talked to me 
Nov 24 01:46:02 <derram>	Anywho, tells me he doesn't want to be esplin
Nov 24 01:46:29 <derram>	I wind up getting linked to mlas1 and see three posts by him perpetuating the Esplin meme
Nov 24 01:46:58 <derram>	He deletes his account, and Andy winds up changing the name of some random account
Nov 24 01:47:04 <derram>	to esplin
Nov 24 01:47:19 <derram>	which, if you know me, I hate people using other people's names
Nov 24 01:47:23 <derram>	so I asked esplin 
Nov 24 01:47:35 <derram>	he said it wasn't him and had no idea why andy changed the name
Nov 24 01:48:07 <derram>	the next day, Ewan tells me Andy says the name change was requested
Nov 24 01:48:20 <derram>	then the next day I find out that it is indeed esplin
Nov 24 01:48:41 <derram>	How many times would you stand by me lying to you?
Nov 24 01:49:00 <derram>	Oh yeah
Nov 24 01:49:02 <derram>	The crash thing
Nov 24 01:49:05 <derram>	told me it wasn't 
Nov 24 01:49:11 <derram>	turns out it was and he knew
Nov 24 01:49:11 <RisenLM>	Knowing you'd freak out
Nov 24 01:49:16 <derram>	really
Nov 24 01:49:17 <RisenLM>	and you did
Nov 24 01:49:23 <derram>	No I didn't
Nov 24 01:49:40 <derram>	I didn't do anything in relation to crash being modded to mlas1
Nov 24 01:49:47 <derram>	the sub he tried to kill for a year and a half
Nov 24 01:50:23 <derram>	by then, I had learned
Nov 24 01:50:36 <derram>	Andy can do anything, if I respond he'll just lie about me some more
Nov 24 01:50:43 <derram>	no one will say anything 
Nov 24 01:50:51 <derram>	more shit will be spread around as truth

Nov 24 01:52:03 <derram>	>You were banned from the chat for coming in and spamming people multiple times.
Nov 24 01:52:24 <derram>	I was banned for inviting loversh
Nov 24 01:52:46 <derram>	and no one who knows the truth said shit
Nov 24 01:53:21 <derram>	>No, derram, it wasn't once. If it was once we wouldn't be having this conversation. Also you continue to get around the ban by using webchat, coming in just to harass people that don't wanna be in your chat.

Nov 24 02:09:46 <derram>	there's a trend here
