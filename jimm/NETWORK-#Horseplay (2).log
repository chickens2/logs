Jan 26 00:27:32 <Trips>	how hard would it be to rig up a voice activated computer control system for a whole house
Jan 26 00:27:41 <Trips>	or expensive
Jan 26 00:27:45 <RainbowPonySemen>	it probably exists
Jan 26 00:28:06 <Trips>	I want like a star trek house
Jan 26 00:28:27 <Seal>	Trips: very hard
Jan 26 00:28:35 <Seal>	and
Jan 26 00:28:44 <Seal>	from extremely expensive to relatively cheap
Jan 26 00:29:00 <Trips>	what would be hard about it specifically
Jan 26 00:29:01 <Seal>	depending on how much u want to do urself and how much u want to do with it
Jan 26 00:29:03 <Seal>	well
Jan 26 00:29:22 <Seal>	you would need to get a voice recognition thing that would output to a raspberry pi or something
Jan 26 00:29:48 <Seal>	and then you would need to program the thing to output things based on what voice is recognized
Jan 26 00:29:58 <Seal>	and then you would need to hook up the outputs to the things that u want to control
Jan 26 00:30:04 <Seal>	and figure out how to control things with them
Jan 26 00:30:05 <Seal>	and
Jan 26 00:30:10 <Seal>	yea
Jan 26 00:30:41 <Trips>	mmh
Jan 26 00:30:43 <c_h_i_c_k_e_n_s>	they have programmable outlet attachment things
Jan 26 00:30:46 <Trips>	that doesn't sound tremendously hard
Jan 26 00:30:59 <Trips>	I've seen stuff like smart thermostat controllers and whatnot
Jan 26 00:31:17 <Trips>	that u could control from a phone or something
Jan 26 00:31:41 <Seal>	well yeah but with those you don't need a oice recognition thing
Jan 26 00:34:09 <Trips>	:V
Jan 26 00:34:11 <c_h_i_c_k_e_n_s>	the hardest part I think would probably be networking all the microphones around your house together

Jan 26 01:32:56 <Coggler>	I have small veins that scar and sink away. all three. and every. single. time. i have to get something drawn or injected, I warn them, and they're all "hahaha you don't knwo what you're talking about I'll just shove a needle in and dig around" and I'm all "I AM FUCKING WARNING YOU I HAVE DONE INFUSIONS AND BLOOD DRAWINGS EVERY MONTH FOR TEN YEARS I KNOW WHAT THE FUCK I'M SAYING" and they

Jan 26 01:34:48 <Coggler>	My arthritis won't let my arms go straight, so they can't pull it from the insides of my elbows. My left hand got an IV put in every month for many years so it's so scarred that you have to SHOVE a needle in there and instead of it poking in, it just pushes it away, and the other hand's veins are too small so they poke usually 2 or 3 times before finding one.
Jan 26 01:35:12 <Seal>	Coggler: what if they were like "oh, thanks for telling me" and just fucking jammed the needle into your jugular vein

Jan 26 02:26:09 <Coggler>	my family recently went through my dead great grandparents' old belongings and they gave me all of my grandpa's painting supplies. easles, charcoal, paints, etc. do I use them nad risk damaging them (and using up the thngs like paints and stuff) or keep them and respect them like little legacies?
Jan 26 02:26:51 <Seal>	Coggler: do u think ur grandparents would want u to use them
Jan 26 02:26:54 <DrinkiePie>	I'd only use them for stuff I was emotionally attatched to
Jan 26 02:26:54 <DrinkiePie>	idk
Jan 26 02:27:09 <Seal>	u could set up the easel as like a decoration thing
Jan 26 02:27:10 <Seal>	or something
Jan 26 02:27:15 <Seal>	even if u don't use it
Jan 26 02:27:31 <Trips>	I'd use them
Jan 26 02:27:35 <Coggler>	When he first died I got a ton more of his painting stuff and used some of it but then felt guilty (but also relieved I didn't have to buy it myself lmao)
Jan 26 02:27:53 <Coggler>	I think I might use them but only for serious projects I put heart into.
Jan 26 02:28:02 <Seal>	that sounds like a good idea
Jan 26 02:28:03 <Trips>	I'd want art made with my stuff, otherwise what good is it
Jan 26 02:28:08 <Seal>	^
Jan 26 02:28:11 <Coggler>	I was his favorite but he didn't live long enough to find out I'd be art-inclined.
Jan 26 02:28:31 <Coggler>	That's a good point Trips
Jan 26 02:29:06 <Coggler>	I got a rad unopened box of oil pastels that's all withered and yellowed and neat looking.
Jan 26 02:29:12 <Coggler>	I might keep that sealed.
Jan 26 02:29:18 <Coggler>	but the rest I'll probably use
Jan 26 02:34:11 <jeroknite>	Your parent's face when they find out you used it http://gfycat.com/UnselfishFlawedBoilweevil
Jan 26 02:34:26 <jeroknite>	jk, I'm sure it's fine
Jan 26 02:38:23 <Conky>	My Grandma died recently and I inherited her instruments, she had 3 fiddles and 3 guitars
Jan 26 02:38:35 <Conky>	I don't play fiddle or violin but time to learn I guess
Jan 26 02:40:06 <DrinkiePie>	my grandma died when I was a freshamn in college
Jan 26 02:40:17 <DrinkiePie>	we sort of went to her house before they auctioned off everything and took what we liked
Jan 26 02:40:20 <Coggler>	The instruments is really cool
Jan 26 02:40:25 <DrinkiePie>	I got a bunch of stuff from my grandfather's old study
Jan 26 02:40:26 <Coggler>	death is sad times
Jan 26 02:40:34 <DrinkiePie>	it wasn't a big deal for me
Jan 26 02:40:40 <DrinkiePie>	it was one of those things where you knew it was coming
Jan 26 02:40:45 <Coggler>	we made my grandma's funeral a party
Jan 26 02:40:50 <DrinkiePie>	so you were sad but still
Jan 26 02:40:57 <Coggler>	yeah I know what you mean
Jan 26 02:41:07 <DrinkiePie>	the funeral was just some family talking by her grave
Jan 26 02:41:10 <DrinkiePie>	she didnt want a huge funeral
Jan 26 02:41:16 <Coggler>	we knew grandma's death was coming, we loved her to pieces, but she would have kicked our asses if we were depressed. So we went to the funeral then had a giant las vegas party.
Jan 26 02:41:32 <Coggler>	i hate huge funerals 
Jan 26 02:42:13 <Trips>	you know you can't spell "funeral" without "real fun"
Jan 26 02:42:19 <Trips>	:B
Jan 26 02:42:43 <Coggler>	10/10
Jan 26 02:42:45 <Conky>	We had no idea with my grandma, she was only 76, and it happened the day after christmas, it's nice she got to spend time with the whole family before she died, but still so close to christmas is sad.
Jan 26 02:43:21 <Coggler>	that sucks a lot :c
Jan 26 02:43:23 <Coggler>	i'm sorry
Jan 26 02:43:59 <Conky>	I went to see her in the hospital, but at that point she was already brain dead from a second stroke, she was breathing and alive on her own without tubes and what have you, but it was still hard to see her, dead but still breathing and lying there as if she's sleeping
Jan 26 02:44:34 <Coggler>	That's always the worst way to see them :\
Jan 26 02:44:34 <Coggler>	I
Jan 26 02:44:48 <Coggler>	that's going nowhere. typo.
Jan 26 02:46:11 <Conky>	Yeah it was rough, she spent a lot of time with us as kids and growing up, she had a really active role in all our lives, but at the same time she had been sickly for her whole life
Jan 26 02:46:30 <Seal>	https://i.imgur.com/UrBU9hs.gif
Jan 26 02:47:13 <Conky>	I feel bad for my mom because basically her only living family other than us was my grandmother, she said to my sister myself and my father "Except for you I'm an orphan now"

Jan 26 03:38:06 <Seal>	ok
Jan 26 03:39:26 <Princess_Pwny>	To put the foot down, next time someone asks you and you don't listen, Im going to ban you for a week.

Jan 26 03:40:32 <Princess_Pwny>	Escalating punishment for linesplitting and not listening to a mod asking nicely to stop is a sign of a shitty mod?

Jan 26 03:41:32 <Seal>	you can remove me from the stats page if people are worried about their line penis

Jan 26 03:42:13 <jeroknite>	The problem is that you're making a wall of text, and making conversations harder to follow
Jan 26 03:42:28 <Seal>	ok
Jan 26 03:42:39 <Princess_Pwny>	Basically, you are not listening to a mod asking you nicely, so the next step is kicks and bans.

Jan 27 02:22:48 <jeroknite>	How the fuck does anyone follow twitch chat?
Jan 27 02:23:04 <Princess_Pwny>	Twitch chat ain't moving very fast
Jan 27 02:23:39 <jeroknite>	Too fast for me to read
Jan 27 02:23:52 <Princess_Pwny>	Im reading it while typing to you without problems
Jan 27 02:23:57 <jeroknite>	I can read one line before the whole thing scrolls up
Jan 27 02:24:27 <Princess_Pwny>	Im reading 90%+ of it
Jan 27 02:24:54 <Princess_Pwny>	When Im actually reading it that is
Jan 27 02:25:02 <Princess_Pwny>	Im playing minecraft so im just listening and glancing
Jan 27 02:25:10 <jeroknite>	I never learned speed reading
Jan 27 02:26:18 <kwulhu>	what up
Jan 27 02:26:33 <kwulhu>	speed reading is just advanced skimming
Jan 27 02:26:44 <kwulhu>	oh
Jan 27 02:26:45 <kwulhu>	also
Jan 27 02:27:02 <kwulhu>	just saw Django Unchained
Jan 27 02:27:04 <kwulhu>	badass movie
Jan 27 02:27:06 <Princess_Pwny>	Hmm, I can't ever remember learning to speed read, I normally read at a fast pace and reading this fast is just quite natural
Jan 27 02:27:09 <kwulhu>	so much blood
Jan 27 02:27:19 <kwulhu>	also
Jan 27 02:27:26 <kwulhu>	there's not much to "follow"
Jan 27 02:27:35 <kwulhu>	the people aren't really talking to each other
Jan 27 02:28:02 <Princess_Pwny>	Plus you can identify patterns of words and filter out the most common spam lines
Jan 27 02:28:13 <Princess_Pwny>	Like that guy spamming moonlight sonata
Jan 27 02:28:21 <Princess_Pwny>	And the people spamming mad world
Jan 27 02:29:07 <Princess_Pwny>	A bunch of people want chopin, SAO, Studio ghibi and various other anime songs
Jan 27 02:29:40 <Princess_Pwny>	A few people want frozen I guess because thats popular
Jan 27 02:30:25 <Princess_Pwny>	It makes me chuckle when the occasional person says something like "Can you please play this if you know it?" all nice and stuff and it gets scrolled off the screen like a second or two later
Jan 27 02:30:42 <Princess_Pwny>	Sorry guy, I don't think he noticed it
Jan 27 02:31:30 <kwulhu>	wait
Jan 27 02:31:46 <kwulhu>	people request music in twitch chat?
Jan 27 02:31:58 <Princess_Pwny>	...are you even watching the stream?
Jan 27 02:32:13 <Princess_Pwny>	It's literally a guy playing music on a piano
Jan 27 02:32:20 <Princess_Pwny>	of course they are going to ask him to play things
Jan 27 02:32:21 <kwulhu>	I'm not
Jan 27 02:33:11 <kwulhu>	I had no idea what we were talking about
Jan 27 02:34:43 <Seal>	wait
Jan 27 02:34:50 <kwulhu>	ask for Liszt
Jan 27 02:34:50 <Seal>	in the latest hobbit movie
Jan 27 02:34:54 <Seal>	wait
Jan 27 02:34:59 <Seal>	no it was a lord of the rings movie
Jan 27 02:35:11 <Princess_Pwny>	Chat is moving too fast for me to request anything at all
Jan 27 02:35:17 <kwulhu>	okay
Jan 27 02:35:19 <Princess_Pwny>	I think you'd die at this twitch chat
Jan 27 02:35:19 <kwulhu>	then spam it
Jan 27 02:35:26 <Seal>	it shows sauron wearing the ring and then his finger gets chopped off and the guy gets the ring and then he jumps into a river and the ring falls off and the guy gets shot with arrows
Jan 27 02:35:36 <Seal>	but
Jan 27 02:35:42 <Seal>	why isn't sauron invisible
Jan 27 02:35:49 <Princess_Pwny>	Cannot say the same line more than once every 30 seconds, cannot say more than 1 line a second and can only say 20 lines in 30 seconds
Jan 27 02:35:59 <Princess_Pwny>	I can't spam fast enough to keep it on screen
Jan 27 02:36:08 <kwulhu>	find different ways to say Liszt Sonata in B Minor
Jan 27 02:36:23 <bitchcakes>	damn this guy is good
Jan 27 02:36:29 <Seal>	"Lizst Sonata in B Minor"
Jan 27 02:36:35 <jeroknite>	The ring works differently for Sauron, Seal
Jan 27 02:36:36 <Seal>	"Llszt Sonata in B Minor"
Jan 27 02:36:44 <Seal>	jeroknite: o
Jan 27 02:36:46 <Princess_Pwny>	Plus he's just playing popular songs from various anime, t.v shows and stuff

Jan 27 05:22:37 <Dr_Chandra_s>	I wonder if the Anumidium is considered deactivated?

Jan 28 05:57:12 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	HOW DO I FIX THE CPU ISSUE
Jan 28 05:57:16 <Princess_Pwny>	Thats the first thing you do
Jan 28 05:57:19 <Princess_Pwny>	Fucking fastcraft
Jan 28 05:57:27 <Conky>	~yt fastcraft
Jan 28 05:57:27 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Is that compatible with FTB?

Jan 28 05:57:36 <Princess_Pwny>	The thing I linked
Jan 28 05:57:45 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	http://i.imgur.com/tdncJQg.png
Jan 28 05:57:46 <Princess_Pwny>	It's a server-side FTB mod
Jan 28 05:57:47 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	look it this
Jan 28 05:57:51 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	server's idle, no one's on.
Jan 28 05:57:56 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	65% of the CPU
Jan 28 05:58:00 <Princess_Pwny>	yeah thats normal
Jan 28 05:58:02 <jeroknite>	WHY WAS I NEVER AWARE OF THIS BEFORE?
Jan 28 05:58:10 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	how is that normal?
Jan 28 05:58:13 <Princess_Pwny>	It's only ffor 1.7.10 jeroknite 
Jan 28 05:58:29 <jeroknite>	1.7 already runs like a dream, though
Jan 28 05:58:30 <Conky>	You need a bigger cpu
Jan 28 05:58:33 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	I've ran this server before, and it never had this issue.
Jan 28 05:58:39 <Princess_Pwny>	it can go on the client and the server
Jan 28 05:58:43 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Last time I ran it was in like november
Jan 28 05:58:46 <Princess_Pwny>	also use opis to check what is eating your ticks
Jan 28 05:59:05 <jeroknite>	I'll eat your dicks
Jan 28 05:59:08 <jeroknite>	I MEAN TICKS
Jan 28 05:59:12 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Well, it wasn't teh exact server.
Jan 28 05:59:17 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	it was an earlier version.
Jan 28 05:59:44 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	So, fastcraft.
Jan 28 05:59:46 <Princess_Pwny>	Also forge 1.7.10 had a huge bug that caused massive server load when exploring with forge, it was an issue with how forge was rendering chunks
Jan 28 06:00:03 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	It doesn't render chunks when no one's on, does it?
Jan 28 06:00:05 <Princess_Pwny>	Packs might update to fix that, but packs are usually quite slow to update
Jan 28 06:00:34 <Princess_Pwny>	Like my DW20 world was using 50-60% Cpu on idle, 0 people
Jan 28 06:00:49 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	this is DW2.0
Jan 28 06:00:56 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Direwolf, right?
Jan 28 06:00:59 <Princess_Pwny>	Yeah
Jan 28 06:01:03 <jeroknite>	More like DarqWolff
Jan 28 06:01:10 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	kek
Jan 28 06:01:13 <jeroknite>	AM I RIGHT, GUISE?
Jan 28 06:01:14 <Princess_Pwny>	I had to stop hosting it because it was using too much bandwidth for my aus internet to deal with
Jan 28 06:01:28 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	and fastcraft doesn't help with that?
Jan 28 06:01:39 <Princess_Pwny>	It helped with the cpu a bit
Jan 28 06:01:44 <Conky>	no that's wrong
Jan 28 06:01:44 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	ah
Jan 28 06:02:00 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	conky I sware to gob

Jan 28 06:02:51 <jeroknite>	Get a spoon
Jan 28 06:03:02 <jeroknite>	Pour that mod all over your cpu
Jan 28 06:03:23 <jeroknite>	Spread it on the MoBo
Jan 28 06:03:32 <jeroknite>	Then get the peanut butter
Jan 28 06:03:43 <jeroknite>	And a butter knife
Jan 28 06:03:56 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	pwny, do you know the command to force a save?
Jan 28 06:03:58 <jeroknite>	Spread that on the GPU

Jan 28 06:05:01 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	granted, that might just because it's still launching
Jan 28 06:05:03 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	but idk
Jan 28 06:05:41 <Princess_Pwny>	yeah it takes more effect once the server finishes booting
Jan 28 06:06:29 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	it gets up to like 80% CPU while booting
Jan 28 06:06:37 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	and idles around 50 - 60

Jan 28 07:20:00 <Dr_Chandra_s>	On the final mission of halo 3 if the arbiter is shooting the warthog's gun towards the screen I feel a weird  tickle in my chest. Its only that mission that I feel this way
Jan 28 07:20:13 <Conky>	modded skyrim is too realistic for some people http://i.imgur.com/CRGjTPo.png

Jan 28 07:21:29 <jeroknite>	That's the ghosts in your game
Jan 28 07:21:54 <Conky>	yeah I've played that mission like 100 times never felt that ;_;7
Jan 28 07:21:55 <Dr_Chandra_s>	but I'm getting the same feeling from waching a video of that level right now
Jan 28 07:22:00 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Is it ghosts in my chest?
Jan 28 07:22:07 <Conky>	Get yourself checked for some weird alien elite disease

Jan 28 07:28:42 <Conky>	There exists in universe a force that can neither be explained by science nor the greatest intellectual minds that ever lived. It is the most powerful force known to man. Heroes have perished, empires have fallen, and souls have been crushed by its overpowering weight. It is a feel we all have known...   That feel when no girlfriend.

Jan 28 07:32:45 <Dr_Chandra_s>	What
Jan 28 07:32:50 <Dr_Chandra_s>	that's not even the right franchise
Jan 28 07:32:51 <Conky>	Man though I'm a sucker for music like that
Jan 28 07:33:29 <Conky>	Traditional asian music is pretty great, especially mixed with more modern sounds.
Jan 28 07:33:41 <Conky>	Tfw music is the only thing that makes sense anymore
Jan 28 07:34:18 <Dr_Chandra_s>	the latest ESO trailer made it JUST hit me that the nord in the trailer isn't Jorunn Skald-King and the elven woman isn't Queen Ayrenn
Jan 28 07:34:30 <Dr_Chandra_s>	they're just represejntnatives of player characters
Jan 28 07:34:49 <jeroknite>	:c?
Jan 28 07:34:52 <Conky>	Blegh ESO
Jan 28 07:35:22 <Dr_Chandra_s>	I'm super pumped for it going buy to play
Jan 28 07:35:34 <Dr_Chandra_s>	I'm absolutely gonna pick it up at some point
Jan 28 07:35:34 <Conky>	what do you mean?
Jan 28 07:35:40 <Conky>	no more subscriptions?
Jan 28 07:35:44 <jeroknite>	More like super pimped
Jan 28 07:36:02 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Yes
Jan 28 07:36:11 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Subs are gone in March
Jan 28 07:36:54 <Conky>	I've played it for a month or so, it's honestly very meh, it's basically just like any other MMO that gets pumped out except the only gimmick or interesting thing for it is "Hey, Elder Scrolls" it's a pretty awful MMO, and I love Elder Scrolls to a ridiculous degree and usually love MMO's too
Jan 28 07:37:28 <Dr_Chandra_s>	I really liked what I played of it before, definitely enjoyed it more than oblivion
Jan 28 07:37:28 <jeroknite>	Do you have to collect any bear asses in it?
Jan 28 07:37:40 <jeroknite>	That's not saying much, Chandra
Jan 28 07:37:41 <Conky>	they very much made it because they know people will see "Elder scrolls MMO? Boy that sounds like everything I've ever wanted in a Scrolls game"
Jan 28 07:37:43 <Dr_Chandra_s>	(although that's not saying much.  I super hated Oblivion)
Jan 28 07:37:48 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Oh well
Jan 28 07:37:51 <Conky>	Lol Oblivion yeah
Jan 28 07:38:09 <jeroknite>	Speaking of lol
Jan 28 07:38:20 <Conky>	I liked Oblivion for a few things, mostly just some of the Quest design, which had a lot of cool and memorable quests
Jan 28 07:38:29 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Honestly the actual storyy function and world seemed solid, and I'venever really been in TES for the gameplay anyway
Jan 28 07:38:33 <Conky>	compared to like skyrim which has like 4 cool quests and the rest are generic
Jan 28 07:39:06 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Oblivion's quests were great, its dungeons were horrendous.
Jan 28 07:39:22 <Conky>	don't get me wrong I love Skyrim, played like 600 hours, mind you it becomes a lot better when you have 300 mods haha
Jan 28 07:39:25 <Dr_Chandra_s>	And honestly I didn't like the quests all that much eiither
Jan 28 07:39:38 <Conky>	Man there were so many memorable ones though
Jan 28 07:39:52 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Absolutely. Painted world, Hackdirt...
Jan 28 07:40:02 <Conky>	the funnest quest I've ever done in anything was the brotherhood quest for the party trapped in the house haha
Jan 28 07:40:22 <Conky>	and the DLC was great as well
Jan 28 07:40:39 <Conky>	Shivering Aisles was amazing, I mean come on Sheogorath for god sakes
Jan 28 07:40:49 <Dr_Chandra_s>	True dat.
Jan 28 07:40:59 <Dr_Chandra_s>	KOTN was great too
Jan 28 07:41:04 <Dr_Chandra_s>	dat Kirkbride writing
Jan 28 07:41:06 <Conky>	but yeah it had loads of problems, still love that game though
Jan 28 07:41:35 <jeroknite>	I bet you want to make kirk your bride
Jan 28 07:41:41 <Conky>	And of course Morrowind is still fucking adored by all
Jan 28 07:41:53 <Conky>	and it had more problems than most games I've ever played haha
Jan 28 07:41:55 <jeroknite>	It's a good game
Jan 28 07:42:00 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Honestly I feel like I give Skyrim a bit of slack since I know skyrim was ambitious but rushed (See: the massive amount of really good cut content) whereas I Feel that oblivion just made bad design decisions
Jan 28 07:42:02 <jeroknite>	A bit buggy
Jan 28 07:42:30 <Conky>	Yeah skyrim needed like another 6 months or a year and it would probably be considered one of the best games ever made
Jan 28 07:42:41 <Dr_Chandra_s>	God, Morrowind. How I fucking luve that.
Jan 28 07:42:42 <Conky>	Hell it still is I suppose, depends who you ask obviouslyu
Jan 28 07:43:00 <Conky>	I'm thinking of modding morrowind a bit and doing another play of it
Jan 28 07:43:03 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Yeah, but it definitely would have been better complete
Jan 28 07:43:06 <Conky>	sometime this week I'll start
Jan 28 07:43:15 <Dr_Chandra_s>	See: the civil war questline and college of winterhold
Jan 28 07:43:30 <Conky>	There are a lot of massive mods for morrowind, there's a mod team expanding Morrowind to like lore size, they're still working on it
Jan 28 07:43:36 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Both severely gimped for the 11/11/11 date
Jan 28 07:43:37 <Conky>	Been like 10 years of work on one mod
Jan 28 07:43:38 <jeroknite>	The college quest line just ends
Jan 28 07:44:12 <Conky>	The college quest line started off cooool, you though it'd be like hogwarts or some shit, then "Oh go into a cave with draugr"
Jan 28 07:44:23 <Conky>	downhill from there
Jan 28 07:44:27 <Dr_Chandra_s>	the civ war questline would have included a battle/siege for EVERY city, not just Whiterun and then the final city, and the possibility of losing battles and having to try again, resource management, showing war crimes happen...
Jan 28 07:45:07 <Conky>	There's an overhaul mod for civil war that adds things like that
Jan 28 07:45:13 <Conky>	it's pretty damned awesome
Jan 28 07:45:40 <jeroknite>	I still like the dungeons in Oblivion better than the ones in Skyrim
Jan 28 07:45:45 <Conky>	because vanilla civil war has one cool battle for whiterun, then basically a bunch of "go kill 20 weak ass enemies in a fort" to save the city
Jan 28 07:46:03 <Dr_Chandra_s>	example; if you took Markarth as a Stormcloak, there would have been a scene where you were deposing the Jarl, and Ondolemar and the Thalmor ambassadors try to leave too, but Galmar stops him, has him put on his knees, and plants a battleaxe in his skull
Jan 28 07:46:12 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Ondolemar and his ambassadors still die in the final game, but offscreen
Jan 28 07:46:19 <Dr_Chandra_s>	You'd honeslty never notice
Jan 28 07:46:19 <Conky>	The one's in Skyrim have less style and variety to them I find
Jan 28 07:46:24 <Conky>	There are a few amazing dungeons
Jan 28 07:46:28 <jeroknite>	WOOPS LEFT THAT TRIGGER IN
Jan 28 07:46:43 <jeroknite>	I found one good dungeon in Skyim
Jan 28 07:46:51 <jeroknite>	In the Dragon Born expansion
Jan 28 07:47:01 <Conky>	but most are bland as hell, and It's annoying how 99% of them have a perfect loop da loop end path to leave immediately when you reach the end
Jan 28 07:47:03 <jeroknite>	The one with all the magical spiders in it
Jan 28 07:47:07 <jeroknite>	I liked that one
Jan 28 07:47:19 <Dr_Chandra_s>	There's plenty of great dungeons in Skyrim. Oblivion's dungeons, on the other hand....
Jan 28 07:47:43 <Dr_Chandra_s>	thefirst Ayeleid ruin: Great! Unique place! Every other ayeleid ruin: mostly a copypasta of that one
Jan 28 07:47:58 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Hell, even the dev team reflects this; oblivon had ONE dungeon designer
Jan 28 07:48:23 <Dr_Chandra_s>	and there's the fact that many dungeons were just "walk in, kill people, leave through backtracking"
Jan 28 07:48:24 *	tortuga has quit (Connection closed)
Jan 28 07:48:34 <Conky>	Honest to god though the biggest, simple thing that I wanted in Skyrim that I assumed they'd put in, was just being ackjnowledged for your in game choices, you know? Like if I'm the fucking arch mage of the college, maybe some rando apprentice wizard doesn't say "Make it quick I have little time for your petty questions"
Jan 28 07:48:37 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Like, the puzzles in Skyrim's dungeons are scant but at least they're there
Jan 28 07:48:38 *	tortuga (tortuga@no-6tc.6gv.q1t9vq.IP) has joined #Horseplay
Jan 28 07:48:48 <Conky>	the "puzzles" lol
Jan 28 07:48:52 *	PubliqPhirm has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
Jan 28 07:48:55 <jeroknite>	Leaving through backtracking isn't a bad thing, if the dungeon is designed to make good use of space
Jan 28 07:48:58 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Yeah, I know
Jan 28 07:49:00 <Conky>	They were all soooo easy, I mean honestly, just tooooo easy
Jan 28 07:49:08 <Conky>	I don't even like hard puzzles
Jan 28 07:49:09 <Dr_Chandra_s>	They rarely were, Jero
Jan 28 07:49:19 <Conky>	but I atleast want to wrack my brain a bit
Jan 28 07:49:22 <jeroknite>	I know :c
Jan 28 07:49:36 <jeroknite>	SNAKE WHALE HAWK
Jan 28 07:49:45 <Dr_Chandra_s>	I feel like people look at oblivion through rosy goggles. I find myself constantly baffled by it.
Jan 28 07:50:19 <Conky>	Oblivion is easily the worst of the 3, but I still loved it and had loads of fun with it
Jan 28 07:50:39 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Then there's the actual world design. YOu move from the weird, alien, densely packed Vvardenfell where there's always something going on
Jan 28 07:50:46 <Dr_Chandra_s>	to...lots of emtpy grassland
Jan 28 07:50:51 <jeroknite>	^
Jan 28 07:51:15 <Conky>	Playing Skyrim without mods feels so perverse now
Jan 28 07:51:22 <Conky>	Mostly the winter survival mod
Jan 28 07:51:40 <Conky>	the whole speel is that Skyrim is a hard, barren cold place where you have to dig in deep to survive
Jan 28 07:51:47 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Haven't tried frostfall. Honestly a bit afraid
Jan 28 07:51:48 <jeroknite>	Hey, did you ever come across outdoor ruins in Skyrim that looked like there should be something there, but there isn't?
Jan 28 07:52:00 <jeroknite>	Like
Jan 28 07:52:05 <Conky>	And without that system in place you literally never give a fuck or feel it, instead the world feels bland and bleak
Jan 28 07:52:08 <jeroknite>	With levers you can't pull
Jan 28 07:52:12 <Conky>	frostfall is awesome
Jan 28 07:52:25 <Conky>	easily one of my top 10 mods
Jan 28 07:52:38 <Conky>	Yeah jero
Jan 28 07:52:43 <jeroknite>	Did I just not have the quest for those, or did they get forgotten?
Jan 28 07:52:43 <Dr_Chandra_s>	I have, but sometimes those are places that were actual cities during the time of TES1-4 that just fell apart and is flat out gone
Jan 28 07:52:48 <Conky>	some of them get activated later when you start a quest
Jan 28 07:52:49 <Dr_Chandra_s>	like one near Rorikstead
Jan 28 07:52:57 <Conky>	nah Jero they needed quests
Jan 28 07:53:00 <jeroknite>	Shit
Jan 28 07:53:15 <jeroknite>	Because when I found some of those, I thought
Jan 28 07:53:23 <Conky>	Honestly I've played skyrim like 600+ hours and sometimes I still find a small quest I never knew existed
Jan 28 07:53:30 <jeroknite>	"Oh shit, I found some secret treasure!"
Jan 28 07:53:46 <jeroknite>	And then found only disappoint
Jan 28 07:53:51 <Conky>	:(
Jan 28 07:54:08 <Conky>	RIP Jero's happiness 
Jan 28 07:54:25 <jeroknite>	Oh don't worry
Jan 28 07:54:30 <jeroknite>	That died YEARS ago
Jan 28 07:54:38 <Conky>	Another favourite mod of mine is http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8429/?
Jan 28 07:54:44 <Conky>	interesting npc's
Jan 28 07:55:04 <Dr_Chandra_s>	I found secret trasure occasionally, like once outside of a farm west of the Wesstern Watchtower, I found what looked likea pit in the ground with one of those totem puzzles. Did the thing, found some Plate Armor :3
Jan 28 07:55:10 <Conky>	Just adds a shitload of new fully voiced npc's all with pretty unique and in-depth stories and conversation topics
Jan 28 07:55:19 <Conky>	and many have quests and can be used as followers
Jan 28 07:55:50 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Fuckin' SHelur Ice Eye
Jan 28 07:55:52 <Conky>	I modded my whiterun to hell, so in town there are like 30 nps at the inn at night
Jan 28 07:56:23 <Conky>	and people walk around everywhere, it's waaay better when you have like 50 nps and market stalls everywhere instead of like 6 npcs outside
Jan 28 07:56:25 <Dr_Chandra_s>	I start seeing her around Windhelm when I added interesting NPCs
Jan 28 07:56:34 <Dr_Chandra_s>	than I found a male nord with th last name Ice Eye
Jan 28 07:56:35 <Conky>	Lol wut
Jan 28 07:56:42 <Conky>	Ohhh yeah
Jan 28 07:56:43 <Conky>	hahah
Jan 28 07:56:48 <Conky>	that guys hilarious
Jan 28 07:56:51 <Dr_Chandra_s>	I talk to him and he mentions his wife Shelur and how people dislike their realtionship
Jan 28 07:56:55 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Not because she's an orc
Jan 28 07:57:00 <Dr_Chandra_s>	but because he's her father
Jan 28 07:57:03 <Conky>	FUCKING IMMERSION MAN

Jan 28 07:57:29 <jeroknite>	CROSS RACE INCEST NOW IN ELDER SCROLLS CANON
Jan 28 07:57:35 <Conky>	did you ever do the quest where the witch wants you to murder the innocent family?
Jan 28 07:57:35 <Dr_Chandra_s>	My dialogue option when he said that, the ONLY thing availble, was "Wait, what?"
Jan 28 07:57:47 <Conky>	"innocent"
Jan 28 07:57:50 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Nah
Jan 28 07:57:53 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Haven't found it yet

Jan 28 07:58:11 <jeroknite>	Free*
Jan 28 07:58:12 <Conky>	they end up being some insane cult and talking about how they ate their last kid because he didn't want to harvest potatoes
Jan 28 07:58:27 <Conky>	The dialogue is fucking hilarious
Jan 28 07:58:31 <Dr_Chandra_s>	bahaha
Jan 28 07:58:50 <Dr_Chandra_s>	was the option to sympathize with them there?
Jan 28 07:58:55 <jeroknite>	Bitch should have picked the potates

Jan 28 08:40:08 <Conky>	And he makes the moving sound
Jan 28 08:40:12 <Conky>	I fucking love that guy
Jan 28 08:40:42 <Dr_Chandra_s>	When I was younger there was this group of dudes from a local university who came for a visit to our Masjid. I guess they came to learn about islam. I was gonna wash up for midday prayers after islamic studies class when I saw a guy pissing in the wudhu station because he thought it was a urinal. An elderly pakistani gentleman was looking, absolutely mortified.
Jan 28 08:41:22 <Conky>	Yeah bout 1/4th of those words are words I dont know
Jan 28 08:41:34 <Dr_Chandra_s>	So, trying not to make a scene I let the guy know it wasn't a urinal. And he too, was mortified.
Jan 28 08:41:37 <Conky>	but I just assumed some frat bro was pissing in a sacred prayer vestibule
Jan 28 08:41:58 <Dr_Chandra_s>	No, just a sink designed for easy pre-prayer washing ritual
Jan 28 08:42:12 <Conky>	he was pre prayer washing his bladder
Jan 28 08:42:26 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Nah, the pre prayer wash is asuper specific routine
Jan 28 08:43:07 <Conky>	http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/487808930295372358/C86758A7AEA043F97B87CFBEF7490ACC6A08B36A/  tfw Whiterun with open cities is basically more forested than the forests
Jan 28 08:43:48 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Wash the hands three times, then mouth and nose three times, through water kept in palm. Then, wash the face three times making sure you get every corner. Then, the right arm from wrist to elbow three times. Then, left arm same. Then, from the hairline to the nape of the neck once, returning, and the ears.
Jan 28 08:43:59 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Then, the right foot three times and the left three times
Jan 28 08:44:32 <Conky>	In catholic churches the holy water routine is basically either touch or don't touch the holy water, then say whatever religious thing and make a sign of the cross if you want maybe?
Jan 28 08:44:40 <Conky>	Other than that just stand when you sing like 4 times
Jan 28 08:44:59 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Afterards we say the shahadah, the declaration of faith.
Jan 28 08:45:11 <Conky>	sh-HAHA-Dah
Jan 28 08:45:32 <Conky>	that's probly how to pronounce it
Jan 28 08:45:36 <Dr_Chandra_s>	nope
Jan 28 08:45:43 <Dr_Chandra_s>	sha-ha-dah
Jan 28 08:46:51 <Conky>	http://cloud-2.steamusercontent.com/ugc/487808781209201360/4E01EBB849328AE8F601EEBF90E5EC6FF3A93B7C/
Jan 28 08:46:55 <Conky>	poor spriggans
Jan 28 08:46:59 <Dr_Chandra_s>	I remember when I explained the shahadah to my 10th grade history teacher. he was surprised becaause the catholic declaration of faith is realy long but ours is just "I bear witness that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is his messenger"
Jan 28 08:47:40 <Conky>	Wow you don't deliver from evil those who would trespass against you? amen
Jan 28 08:48:27 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Nah, since the declaration of faith is just that; a straightforward declaration that you are of hte islamic faith
Jan 28 08:48:35 <Dr_Chandra_s>	No fluff
Jan 28 08:49:16 <Conky>	that's why thr catholic one should be changed to "Yay god"
Jan 28 08:49:53 <Conky>	http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/3317210857543702636/C01E51F9EBB25F4D21EB2BB72847C3B349211D8E/

Jan 28 14:04:57 <Conky>	yeah
Jan 28 14:05:07 <minibug>	never played it before
Jan 28 14:05:16 <minibug>	im a boring person
Jan 28 14:05:20 <Conky>	Wow
Jan 28 14:05:27 <Conky>	you're really letting me down here
Jan 28 14:05:35 <minibug>	:( sorry conky
Jan 28 14:05:43 <Conky>	it's alright buddy
Jan 28 14:06:03 <Conky>	What about Mahjong
Jan 28 14:06:08 <Conky>	never played that before
Jan 28 14:06:20 <minibug>	ive played mahjong
Jan 28 14:06:21 <Conky>	seems like the asian game that old women play instead of bingo
Jan 28 14:06:41 <minibug>	oh god i didnt know my mom was asian
Jan 28 14:06:48 <Conky>	It's true
Jan 28 14:07:02 <Conky>	you can't play Mahjong if you're not Asian
Jan 28 14:07:19 <minibug>	oh god im asian?
Jan 28 14:07:26 <Conky>	Oh man chinese checkers is fun too
Jan 28 14:07:34 <Conky>	yeah you must be
Jan 28 14:07:40 <minibug>	im not asian enough to have played chinese checkers
Jan 28 14:07:56 <minibug>	i like board games like othello and backgammon
Jan 28 14:07:56 <Conky>	i played that game when I was like 8-12 all the time
Jan 28 14:08:06 <Conky>	Backgammon is great
Jan 28 14:08:12 <Conky>	never played othello
Jan 28 14:08:38 <minibug>	you may have heard it called Reversi?
Jan 28 14:08:41 <Conky>	I had a buddy who I used to play those style of games with all the time hours on end, chess club representing
Jan 28 14:08:45 <Conky>	nope
Jan 28 14:08:49 <Conky>	Never heard of thart
Jan 28 14:08:59 <Conky>	I know what Othello is just never played
Jan 28 14:09:38 <minibug>	i understand how to play chess, im just an awful strategist
Jan 28 14:10:21 <Conky>	Hah, I've always loved chess, I'm not great at it in any way but it's really fun to put a lot of effort and thought into a game
Jan 28 14:10:51 <Conky>	Mind you half the time if I'm not in the mood I just play like an idiot, for shits or to relax
Jan 28 14:10:56 <minibug>	i try to do that, and then i just go "yay horsee' and get my ass handed to me
Jan 28 14:12:18 <minibug>	knights are my crutch
Jan 28 14:12:48 <Conky>	I usually try to play without relying on my knights, even though they're easily your best pieces beside your queen obviously
Jan 28 14:13:27 <minibug>	they're not even my crutch
Jan 28 14:13:32 <minibug>	they're my wheelchair
Jan 28 14:14:10 <Conky>	All this chess talk reminds me of harry potter 1st movie when ron was on the knight and it was sacrificed and he was on it when it broke
Jan 28 14:14:25 <Conky>	Why didn't he just get off before hand, they didn't say he couldn't did they?

Jan 28 15:04:35 <Conky>	That fucking makes sense
Jan 28 15:04:55 <c_h_i_c_k_e_n_s>	why not
Jan 28 15:04:57 <Conky>	Video games are hard
Jan 28 15:04:57 <c_h_i_c_k_e_n_s>	its like grade inflation
Jan 28 15:05:09 <RainbowPonySemen>	 stop playing league problem solved
Jan 28 15:05:09 <c_h_i_c_k_e_n_s>	the playerbase gets better, fewer new players
Jan 28 15:05:28 <jeep8790>	https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/asylum/identity hey look another amazingly grand MMO on kickstarter that will probaby never reach half its goals and crash and burn
Jan 28 15:05:34 <Conky>	New message from Riot "Good work doing well in new season, to commerate your performance, go fuck yourself we're demoting you nerd"
Jan 28 15:06:08 <c_h_i_c_k_e_n_s>	plus multiplayer games are more fun at lower skill levels
Jan 28 15:06:09 <jeep8790>	its pretty much second life just without any of the customization and furries
Jan 28 15:06:33 <Conky>	nah Jeep it will be scrapped half way through and turned into a furry dating simulator
Jan 28 15:06:39 <jeep8790>	heh
Jan 28 15:07:12 <jeep8790>	i mean
Jan 28 15:07:13 <jeep8790>	though
Jan 28 15:07:17 <jeep8790>	we have star citizen
Jan 28 15:07:23 <Conky>	so in other words it's a player driven world where they assume people won't just go around killing everyone and fucking shit up
Jan 28 15:07:24 <jeep8790>	so anything is possible i guess
Jan 28 15:07:30 <jeep8790>	yes
Jan 28 15:07:38 <Conky>	Good luck B )
Jan 28 15:07:48 <jeep8790>	yep
Jan 28 15:08:09 <Conky>	star citizen should be pretty good man
Jan 28 15:08:13 <Conky>	I believe
Jan 28 15:08:23 <Conky>	did you sign up for it? Join the Wharf
Jan 28 15:08:37 <jeep8790>	yeah it actually looks like it wont crash and burn under its own weight
Jan 28 15:08:44 <jeep8790>	which is goddamned impressive
Jan 28 15:08:46 <jeep8790>	nope

Jan 28 15:09:26 <Conky>	Lol
Jan 28 15:09:27 <Conky>	no
Jan 28 15:09:30 <jeep8790>	but expaneded massively

Jan 28 15:10:27 *	RainbowPonySemen has quit (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
Jan 28 15:11:24 <jeep8790>	but can i make a security company to protect ships from space bandits?
Jan 28 15:11:36 <jeep8790>	this is all i need to know
Jan 28 15:12:50 <Conky>	yeah
Jan 28 15:12:56 <Conky>	I plan on being a bandit
Jan 28 15:13:00 <jeep8790>	wow
Jan 28 15:13:05 <jeep8790>	you filthy scum
Jan 28 15:13:34 <Conky>	But no it's not like Eve, Eve is all about strategy and what not, star citizen is more about how good of a pilot you are
Jan 28 15:13:51 <Sparkles>	Someone give me ebola I don't want to go to work
Jan 28 15:13:54 <Conky>	I mean obviously the better ship wins if it's one sided
Jan 28 15:14:41 <Conky>	but Eve is a very unique thing they're not really comparable beyond the genre which is admittedly the same more or less
Jan 28 15:14:56 <jeep8790>	thats what i meant

Jan 28 15:15:29 <Conky>	Just going to go on exploration missions, we have 3 fighters and a larger assault type frigate and we gonna roll in formation and fuck up anything in our way
Jan 28 15:16:10 <jeep8790>	also the idea of multi crewed ships in first person view gets me super hard
Jan 28 15:16:14 <Conky>	what I really want to do is pose as mercenaries that will protect transport missions for hire, and then when in a discrete location raid their ships
Jan 28 15:16:24 <jeep8790>	but
Jan 28 15:16:28 <Conky>	but that'll give our corp a pretty shit reputation haha
Jan 28 15:16:38 <jeep8790>	everyone would know about you guys fairly quickly
Jan 28 15:16:40 <jeep8790>	yeah
Jan 28 15:16:44 <c_h_i_c_k_e_n_s>	if its anything like Eve, no one will bother trying to hire protection because everyone is space bandits
Jan 28 15:16:45 <jeep8790>	that wouldnt work very well
Jan 28 15:17:00 <Conky>	Oh it will work once
Jan 28 15:17:03 <c_h_i_c_k_e_n_s>	and you shouldn't be in a pvp zone if you're not looking for people to kill anyways
Jan 28 15:17:04 <Conky>	and that's all we need
Jan 28 15:17:13 <c_h_i_c_k_e_n_s>	better get in on it early then
Jan 28 15:17:19 <Conky>	well I'm in it now
Jan 28 15:17:20 <Conky>	sooo
Jan 28 15:17:30 <c_h_i_c_k_e_n_s>	yea

Jan 28 15:20:29 <Conky>	well you can't get into alpha, beta is like 1-3 years away so I dunno
Jan 28 15:20:56 <c_h_i_c_k_e_n_s>	I'm trying to read about it but it isn't clear at all how the mechanics are supposed to work for that game
Jan 28 15:20:59 <Conky>	Actually I think you can get into alpha for limited time if you pay X amount not sure, you get nothing in game though

Jan 28 15:34:18 <Conky>	it also sounds like a lot of fun for people without ships, you can just co-pilot with a friend or go on a large ship 
Jan 28 15:34:44 <Conky>	So a buddy of mine with a larger ship can just bring around all the new guys with no ships
Jan 28 15:34:55 <jeep8790>	id assume you would have to have dedicated security on some of the larger ones
Jan 28 15:35:02 <jeep8790>	wait
Jan 28 15:35:06 <jeep8790>	is boarding even a thing
Jan 28 15:35:09 <jeep8790>	cause i sure hope so
Jan 28 15:35:19 <Conky>	I'm assuming it is just logically but not sure
Jan 28 15:35:33 <Conky>	I know it will be for some of the massive ships and stations
Jan 28 15:35:33 <jeep8790>	i mean id imagine its hard as hell to make it happen
Jan 28 15:35:46 <Conky>	but smaller or mid sized ships not sure
Jan 28 15:35:47 <jeep8790>	but they have been doing so much shit so far ir wouldnt suprise me

Jan 28 16:50:33 <RariBot>	A PONIS is the long, stringy ponytail found on (usually) older men, aging hippy types, typically with thinning hair (or just about NO hair), where each existing strand is lovingly washed and tended so that it can be carefully included in the skinny ponis, the purpose of which is to show that the bearer is still hip, still cool, and maybe still a bit virile. A ponis rarely looks good, often looks ratty, and should usually be CUT OFF!!

Jan 28 21:05:19 <Seal>	c_h_i_c_k_e_n_s: it starts from a fresh install
Jan 28 21:05:31 <Seal>	so it's really just a timer of how long it takes you to bind left click to scroll wheel down
Jan 28 21:05:33 <Conky>	It's funny because like 99% of the weeby games are awful even by weeb game standards, it's literally people cashing in on people buying the games for the steam trading cards, badges and emotes

Jan 28 21:08:14 <c_h_i_c_k_e_n_s>	but you only get steam money, youc ant get real money
Jan 28 21:08:25 <Seal>	set the price to whatever u want but if u set it to the current steam price it'll sell fast

Jan 29 03:24:01 <jeroknite>	Latin is the only way to cast the magics, Seal
Jan 29 03:24:02 <minibug>	pope speaks latin checkmate athiests
Jan 29 03:24:29 <jeroknite>	More people speak latin than people who speak Cherokee 
Jan 29 03:24:39 <Seal>	In contrast to an extinct language, which no longer has any speakers, a dead language may remain in use for scientific, legal, or ecclesiastical functions. Old Church Slavonic, Classical Armenian, Avestan, Coptic, Biblical Hebrew, New Testament Greek, Ge'ez, Ardhamagadhi, Pali, Sanskrit and Latin are among the many dead languages used as sacred languages. Courses and active teaching still exist for these, as well as Egyptian Hieroglyphs and Maya script.
Jan 29 03:25:34 <minibug>	Latin is less dead than cherokee? Bonus dicere
Jan 29 03:25:50 <Seal>	implying cherokee isn't a dead language too
Jan 29 03:25:58 <Seal>	implying every language other than english isn't a dead language
Jan 29 03:25:59 <Seal>	or
Jan 29 03:26:01 <Seal>	at least
Jan 29 03:26:08 <Seal>	they'll be dead by the time the US is done with them ;)
Jan 29 03:26:10 <jeroknite>	Oh, and there's that language that's only spoken by two people

Jan 29 03:58:20 <iocaineP>	yes

Jan 29 03:59:23 <Seal>	3 chickens for eggs
Jan 29 03:59:32 <Seal>	perfectly reasonable

Jan 29 03:59:43 <minibug>	None of them are the smartest kids :/
Jan 29 03:59:53 <Seal>	we would have chickens if I had any say in the matter

Jan 29 04:02:05 <jeroknite>	Back in MY day, you could trade 3 chickens for 1 whole GOAT!
Jan 29 04:02:13 <Seal>	jeroknite: that's a pretty cheap goat
Jan 29 04:02:20 <minibug>	You told me to rip their brains
Jan 29 04:02:23 <Seal>	o'
Jan 29 04:02:24 <jeroknite>	Chickens used to be worth more
Jan 29 04:02:26 <Seal>	right
Jan 29 04:02:30 <Seal>	jeroknite: did they
Jan 29 04:02:34 <jeroknite>	Probably
Jan 29 04:02:38 <Seal>	I dunno
Jan 29 04:02:40 <jeroknite>	I mean
Jan 29 04:02:42 <jeroknite>	A long time ago
Jan 29 04:02:44 <Seal>	I'd imagine they've always been fairly cheap
Jan 29 04:02:51 <Seal>	esp since they used to produce less meat
Jan 29 04:02:53 <Seal>	and less eggs
Jan 29 04:02:54 <jeroknite>	Back when people traded chickens for goats
Jan 29 04:02:54 <iocaineP>	heh
Jan 29 04:02:56 <iocaineP>	fairly cheep
Jan 29 04:02:58 <iocaineP>	nice one seal

Jan 29 04:03:48 <jeroknite>	People think Big Bird is a suit, but no

Jan 29 04:04:46 <minibug>	I've got a question about talking animals
Jan 29 04:05:11 <minibug>	We taught a gorilla sign language, right?
Jan 29 04:05:15 <Seal>	yes
Jan 29 04:05:19 <Seal>	kiki or something
Jan 29 04:05:27 <Seal>	actually no
Jan 29 04:05:28 <Seal>	it was uh
Jan 29 04:05:30 <Seal>	well
Jan 29 04:05:38 <minibug>	Is it intelligent enough to understand its a gorilla and we're humans?
Jan 29 04:05:39 <Seal>	fairly sure that the gorilla's name was different but there's like
Jan 29 04:06:05 <Seal>	communities of apes in zoos that all know sign language and teach each other sign language and talk to humans with it
Jan 29 04:06:05 <Seal>	and like
Jan 29 04:06:09 <Seal>	invent new words and shit
Jan 29 04:06:23 <minibug>	Since it can communicate, is it now an equal?
Jan 29 04:06:32 <Seal>	I dunno
Jan 29 04:06:36 <Seal>	less intelligent so not equal
Jan 29 04:06:45 <Seal>	but more equal than totally dumb animals
Jan 29 04:06:49 <Seal>	and
Jan 29 04:06:56 <Seal>	minibug: the gorilla's name is koko
Jan 29 04:06:57 <Seal>	or
Jan 29 04:06:58 <Seal>	was?
Jan 29 04:07:08 <minibug>	Mentally disabled = not equal as well?
Jan 29 04:07:15 <Seal>	is
Jan 29 04:07:33 <Seal>	minibug: arguably yes but people are too sentimental to say so
Jan 29 04:08:13 <minibug>	Even the mentally disabled understand that they are humans, though
Jan 29 04:08:30 <Seal>	intelligence is the only thing that separates us from animals and if someone is too dumb to do anything but shit and eat they're not really human on the same level as non-disabled people but people don't like saying that because it's really insensitive
Jan 29 04:08:47 <Seal>	minibug: who says that they can
Jan 29 04:08:52 <Seal>	if they're disabled enough they might not
Jan 29 04:08:53 <Seal>	and
Jan 29 04:09:07 <Seal>	minibug: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test
Jan 29 04:09:38 <minibug>	There's a species of magpie that passes the test, right?
Jan 29 04:09:48 <Seal>	probably
Jan 29 04:09:54 <Seal>	but humans don't until 15 to 18 months old
Jan 29 04:09:57 <Seal>	so
Jan 29 04:10:07 <Seal>	yeah
Jan 29 04:10:30 <Seal>	I dunno, the mirror test might not be completely applicable
Jan 29 04:11:18 <Seal>	I don't get your "understand that they're humans" thing tho
Jan 29 04:11:18 <Seal>	like
Jan 29 04:11:23 <Seal>	worms understand that they're worms
Jan 29 04:11:31 <Seal>	or else they'd be trying to have sex with other species
Jan 29 04:11:51 <Seal>	maybe not on a philosophical level but they "understand" that they're different species
Jan 29 04:12:55 <Seal>	and
Jan 29 04:13:17 <Seal>	minibug: the magpie species you were thinking of is the european magpie
Jan 29 04:13:39 <minibug>	But we, as humans, can use sign language to speak directly to a non human
Jan 29 04:14:00 <Seal>	right
Jan 29 04:14:02 <minibug>	Which is kind of amazing
Jan 29 04:14:05 <Seal>	mhm
Jan 29 04:14:53 <minibug>	Does the gorilla know that we built the cage and place it lives in? That we own a majority of earth?
Jan 29 04:15:27 <Seal>	I dunno
Jan 29 04:15:30 <Seal>	maybe
Jan 29 04:15:36 <Seal>	learn sign language and ask the gorilla
Jan 29 04:15:41 <Seal>	also
Jan 29 04:16:20 <Seal>	apparently the results have been criticized by people because they say the apes are just repeating stuff that we do until they get rewarded and then they do that stuff
Jan 29 04:17:25 <Seal>	like that horse
Jan 29 04:17:43 <minibug>	?
Jan 29 04:17:51 <minibug>	...horse?
Jan 29 04:18:41 <Seal>	there was a horse that people thought could count by pawing the ground but they did tests and figured out the horse just pawed the ground until they gave the horse a reward
Jan 29 04:19:10 <Seal>	so they'd say 3 and the horse would start scraping and once it reached 3 they'd say "good job" or whatever and the horse would stop
Jan 29 04:19:14 <Seal>	also
Jan 29 04:19:37 <Seal>	that gorilla that learned sign language apparently adopted a kitten but then the kitten escaped from the cage and got hit by a car
Jan 29 04:19:38 <Seal>	;_;
Jan 29 04:19:48 <iocaineP>	:c
Jan 29 04:20:04 <minibug>	Isn't there a dog they taught to do basic math?
Jan 29 04:20:25 <minibug>	Like5 + 3 and 2 - 1
Jan 29 04:20:50 <Seal>	minibug: ur probably thinking of the horse
Jan 29 04:20:58 <Seal>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_Hans
Jan 29 04:21:22 <Seal>	apparently it was more subtle than I thought
Jan 29 04:21:23 <Seal>	but
Jan 29 04:21:24 <Seal>	sitll
Jan 29 04:21:25 <Seal>	still*
Jan 29 04:21:27 <minibug>	No this was more recent, and definitely a dog
Jan 29 04:21:29 <Seal>	oh
Jan 29 04:21:45 <Seal>	http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Maggie-the-Dog-Does-Math
Jan 29 04:21:46 <Seal>	there
Jan 29 04:21:51 <Seal>	probably the same thing
Jan 29 04:22:05 <Seal>	fairly sure dogs aren't smart enough to actually do math
Jan 29 04:22:13 <Seal>	horses are probably smarter than dogs, actually

Jan 29 11:52:34 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Then it cuts to you as a baby and and he's black now
Jan 29 11:53:35 <kwulhu>	heh
Jan 29 11:54:06 <kwulhu>	Maybe skin color is recessive in that universe
Jan 29 11:54:29 <kwulhu>	or the mother has some explaining to.do

Jan 29 11:56:19 <kwulhu>	heh
Jan 29 11:57:00 <kwulhu>	in Mount & Blade: Warband, you can fully change your appearance at any time
Jan 29 11:57:28 <Dr_Chandra_s>	funny thing is, your mother in F3 is always black. In the beginning birth segment you can see her legs are very dark, spawning her via console commands lets you see she's black, and there's a picture of her and your father in New Vegas (using the default White father) showing that she's black.
Jan 29 11:57:40 <Vidya>	It's extremely odd to hear liam neeson's voice coming from a black or hispanic guy.

Jan 29 12:36:22 <Conky>	WOOO Thanks Nintendo I love you
Jan 29 12:36:38 <Vidya>	They don't go by nintendo anymore.
Jan 29 12:36:41 <Conky>	Metroid trilogy is being sold digitally for Wii-u for 10 bucks
Jan 29 12:36:45 <Vidya>	It's "New Nintendo"
Jan 29 12:36:54 <Conky>	costs like 80-100 to buy the phycial copy
Jan 29 12:37:08 <Vidya>	They also have a premium version called "New Nintendo XL"
Jan 29 12:37:22 <Conky>	you laugh but you'll buy it and love it
Jan 29 12:37:43 <Conky>	EAT THE FOOD, you like the food
Jan 29 12:38:36 <Vidya>	Can we agree that nintendo's naming conventions make no sense?
Jan 29 12:38:38 <Conky>	alls I know is I bought mario galaxy 2 and metroid trilogy for 20 bucks, and that's a god damned bargain friend
Jan 29 12:39:11 <Conky>	their naming conventions are pretty silly, but they get the point across
Jan 29 12:39:59 <Conky>	Man I cant wait for mario party 10 and splatoon and Xenoblade
Jan 29 12:40:13 <Conky>	And god Please mario galaxy 3 nintendo please

Jan 29 12:40:42 <Conky>	Lol
Jan 29 12:40:51 <Conky>	I don't know why that is rather funny
Jan 29 12:41:11 <Vidya>	Because 2DS is a dumb design.

Jan 29 12:41:13 <Vidya>	Buuuuuuuut
Jan 29 12:41:21 <Vidya>	70 bucks less than a 3ds
Jan 29 12:41:33 <Conky>	^
Jan 29 12:41:46 <Conky>	I own the regular just 3ds
Jan 29 12:42:24 <Conky>	the 2ds feels like it doesn't need to exist and it really doesn't but hey it's an option if you want a budget ds without 3d 
Jan 29 12:42:41 <Vidya>	That's essentially what I want.
Jan 29 12:42:51 <Vidya>	Would prefer just a regular old 3ds without 3d tho
Jan 29 12:42:59 <Esplin>	I would get a 2dssince i can't see the 3d effects on a 3ds
Jan 29 12:43:01 <Vidya>	Seems more comfortable than this thing.
Jan 29 12:43:15 <Conky>	Yeah I dunno I haven't used the 2ds
Jan 29 12:43:21 <Conky>	but I imagine it';s not that bad
Jan 29 12:43:44 <Conky>	Nintendo has done remarkbly well at making controllers that look unwieldy actually working very well.
Jan 29 12:44:17 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Esplin, you can't see the 3d?
Jan 29 12:44:18 <Vidya>	I actually got to hold a Wii-U controller(with the screen), I can definitely agree.
Jan 29 12:44:35 <Vidya>	Side from of course the N64 pad.
Jan 29 12:44:41 <Conky>	Seriously right?
Jan 29 12:44:47 *	kwunicorn (Joseph@no-co5.jl2.4q780k.IP) has joined #Horseplay
Jan 29 12:45:09 <Vidya>	Although, the gamecube pad is still the most comfortable I've ever used.
Jan 29 12:45:10 <Conky>	When I got my Wii u took the gamepad out and was like "Well fuck me this is big" But it fits easily in your hands and feels pretty damn good
Jan 29 12:45:27 <Conky>	I still prefer the wii-u pro though which is more along the lines of what I'm used to.
Jan 29 12:45:53 <Conky>	wii-u pro is basically a 360 controller more or less
Jan 29 12:46:28 <Vidya>	Gamecube one was just right. Willing to bet if it had an extra shoulder button it still would have worked out well.
Jan 29 12:46:33 <Esplin>	http://i.imgur.com/nCtLIwJ.jpg
Jan 29 12:46:39 <minibug>	Wii u takes some getting used to
Jan 29 12:47:09 <Vidya>	Kinda pissed that nintendo is selling it without USB adapters tho
Jan 29 12:47:09 <Conky>	yeah there's a good reason so many wii-u gamecube controllers are being sold as well as adapters
Jan 29 12:47:13 <Conky>	Mostly for smash bros
Jan 29 12:47:57 <Vidya>	My thing is why not make a usb version, add an extra shoulder button and maybe another button above "start"
Jan 29 12:48:26 <Conky>	Eh it loses it's purpose if you change the design of the controller
Jan 29 12:48:38 <Conky>	but a usb version should be a thing
Jan 29 12:49:16 <Conky>	I mean the adapter is only like 15 bucks but it still sucks to need it when they're making new gamecube controllers anyways
Jan 29 12:50:02 <Conky>	Although seeing as you can have 8 people on one wii-u and have 2 usb slots you'd need the adapter anyways if you have more than 2 players
Jan 29 12:50:33 <Vidya>	Yeah, about 30 for the pad(IIRC) and then it goes up to 45 if you get the adapter.

Jan 29 12:51:32 <Conky>	the pro controller is really great, 2nd favourite controller I've ever used
Jan 29 12:51:39 <Conky>	And trust me I've used plenty B )

Jan 29 18:37:59 <Vidya>	At the very least, I'm grateful for that.
Jan 29 18:37:59 <SA>	I thought it was gonna be more like the Sarah Connor chronicles
Jan 29 18:38:07 <SA>	which were th Bomb.com
Jan 29 18:38:15 <Vidya>	But how else would you bring back arnie?
Jan 29 18:38:34 <SA>	A Sarah Connor chronicles movie would be so rad
Jan 29 18:38:43 <Espgaming>	http://i.imgur.com/O3T4Q1S.png
Jan 29 18:39:15 <Vidya>	Same time though, I guess the whole "Sent the terminator too far back in time" thing makes sense. 
Jan 29 18:40:14 <Vidya>	Like Reese said in the first movie, they sweat and bleed just like humans, so they must age.
Jan 29 18:41:17 <Vidya>	Also, I'm surprised that the whole time paradox thing wasn't brought up earlier.
Jan 29 18:41:20 <SA>	maybe 
Jan 29 18:41:37 <SA>	i havnt seen a terminator sweat
Jan 29 18:42:03 <Vidya>	Not the terminator itself, but the human flesh wrap it has.

Jan 29 18:43:26 <SA>	I dont have a good memory of the origional movies, but in the chronicles i dont think they sweated
Jan 29 18:43:32 <Vidya>	So yeah, half of the shit makes sense, but the rest of it looks like contrived modern hollywood bullshit. Plus, PG-13.
Jan 29 18:43:44 <Espgaming>	http://i.imgur.com/w0ENvBV.gif
Jan 29 18:43:52 <Vidya>	Yeah, in the first one, you can definitely see Arnie sweating.

It was like swimming against a current that swept you backwards however hard you struggled, and then suddenly deciding to turn round and go with the current instead of opposing it. Nothing had changed except your own attitude: the predestined thing happened in any case. He hardly knew why he had ever rebelled."    RIP Winston

Jan 30 04:16:15 <Seal>	or something
Jan 30 04:16:24 <Seal>	that's what I gathered from this post on some tech support website

Jan 30 04:17:25 <iocaineP>	Yeah since mouse movements are a CPU interrupt
Jan 30 04:17:40 <Seal>	and apparently the way that programs that add multiple mouse pointers works is that it just draws the mouse pointers and executes the commands from the pointers sequentially
Jan 30 04:17:41 <Seal>	so there's like
Jan 30 04:17:47 <Seal>	one real mouse and the others are fakes

Jan 30 11:23:14 <minibug>	ive tried proxies and they dont work ;_;

Jan 30 12:55:32 <Conky>	I recently found an old 2 dollar bill Canadian, one of the last 2 dollar bills to be circulated, last month of them made and it's mint condition, in like 100 years it might be worth 100 bucks.
Jan 30 12:56:12 <Conky>	It was hype though because some 2 dollar bills sell for about 25,000$ due to some clerical errors which had the wrong signature on them

Jan 30 12:58:26 <Conky>	It's usually true
Jan 30 12:58:44 <Conky>	any time a man picks a coin I've never see him not take the most valueable one cost wise
Jan 30 12:59:00 <Conky>	and when any women I've seen flip a coin they just pick any at random
Jan 30 12:59:34 <jeroknite>	I've only ever seen people use quarters, except when they're not available
Jan 30 12:59:49 <Conky>	to the point where when studying once and flipping a coin as to where to eat, the one girl in the group of 6 people the rest guys tried to flip a nickel instead of a quarter and there was heated debate and anger

Jan 30 15:07:54 <Conky>	that movies great
Jan 30 15:08:02 <jeep8790>	>great canadian movie is about hockey
Jan 30 15:08:04 <Conky>	but you have to like hockey
Jan 30 15:08:05 <jeep8790>	im not suprised
Jan 30 15:08:13 <jeep8790>	well
Jan 30 15:08:22 <jeep8790>	i probably wont like it then
Jan 30 15:08:40 <jeep8790>	seeing as i dont really enjoy any sportsball
Jan 30 15:08:59 <ShitpostReader>	http://redd.it/2u8clh > [MLASCONFESSIONS] MLAS Confessions 1/30/2015
Jan 30 15:09:49 <Conky>	But no there really aren't that many canadian films, the thing is the industry has no niche because we get everything you guys get, so any actor, or pro related to the movie business from Canada will just work in america
Jan 30 15:10:10 <jeep8790>	thats kinda sad
Jan 30 15:10:18 <jeep8790>	inevitable but kinda sad
Jan 30 15:10:38 <Conky>	Like there are plenty of canadian actors even some really famous ones but they probably about 90% of the time act in american made movies and live in america
Jan 30 15:11:13 <Conky>	yeah, there are like Indie movies you could say but none of them are really popular beyond film buffs, and a good portion of them are french
Jan 30 15:12:27 <Conky>	Tv however Canada has a pretty good track record for tv shows, animated shows and what have you
Jan 30 15:13:35 <Conky>	But America kind of has the market cornered, raped into submission when it comes to north american movies
Jan 30 15:14:09 <Conky>	http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2319580/  
Jan 30 15:14:23 <Conky>	I liked that movie a lot, it's about a town in Newfoundland
Jan 30 15:14:41 <Conky>	You might have to be Canadian to really appreciate it though because it's pretty canucky
Jan 30 15:15:30 <jeep8790>	the two actors on that poster look just enough like other actors to make it wierd
Jan 30 15:17:14 <Conky>	Brendan Gleeson Has got to be one of my favourite actors
Jan 30 15:17:29 <jeep8790>	beardy or the black haired guy?
Jan 30 15:17:31 <Conky>	I like everything I've seen him in and he's goddamn hilarious
Jan 30 15:17:36 <Conky>	beardy
Jan 30 15:17:49 <jeep8790>	beardy guys are generally funny
Jan 30 15:17:50 <Conky>	He was the lead in The Guard, and main in "in bruges"
Jan 30 15:18:24 <jeep8790>	welp downloadin
Jan 30 15:18:27 <Conky>	He's an Irish guy, watching him play a newfy was great
Jan 30 15:18:36 <Conky>	In Bruges is fucking hilarious
Jan 30 15:18:45 <jeep8790>	its got whats his face
Jan 30 15:18:51 <Conky>	as long as you don't hate the "British" style comedy
Jan 30 15:18:55 <jeep8790>	that like semi b-list actor
Jan 30 15:18:57 <jeep8790>	right
Jan 30 15:19:16 <jeep8790>	colin farrel
Jan 30 15:19:43 <Conky>	I love those movies because they manage to be fucking hilarious at every turn while also still having an interesting plot that can be damned sad and make you care
Jan 30 15:20:18 <jeep8790>	stop making me watch all these movies
Jan 30 15:20:26 <Conky>	You get tired of Brain dead comedy so more clever comedy is always good
Jan 30 15:20:44 <Conky>	I really love a lot of movies
Jan 30 15:20:52 <jeep8790>	seen Nightcrawler
Jan 30 15:20:55 <jeep8790>	or heard of it
Jan 30 15:21:32 <Conky>	I'm not very picky I basically group movies I see into "Amazing" "Good" "Meh" "Fuck this I'm going to watch the news"
Jan 30 15:21:47 <Conky>	haven't seen it yet
Jan 30 15:21:55 <Conky>	How is it?
Jan 30 15:21:58 <jeep8790>	ill probably watch it tonight
Jan 30 15:22:02 <jeep8790>	it looks good
Jan 30 15:22:07 <jeep8790>	and people seem to like it
Jan 30 15:22:15 <iocaineP>	http://sonicbloom.org/blog/index.php/tag/lake-champlain/page/3/
Jan 30 15:22:17 <Conky>	Yeah I've heard good for it
Jan 30 15:22:20 <Conky>	http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405094/  
Jan 30 15:22:31 <iocaineP>	that unfortunate domain
Jan 30 15:22:39 <Conky>	I recently watched that movie, if you like foreign films it's great
Jan 30 15:22:48 <Conky>	One of the best ends to a movie I've ever watched
Jan 30 15:23:09 <Conky>	Man Champlain Was awesome
Jan 30 15:23:10 <jeep8790>	seen No Country for Old men?
Jan 30 15:23:17 <Conky>	yeah Love that movie
Jan 30 15:23:20 <jeep8790>	yes
Jan 30 15:23:36 <jeep8790>	McCarthy's books are pretty great too
Jan 30 15:24:09 <jeep8790>	seen Fury?
Jan 30 15:24:25 <Conky>	Yeah actually just saw that a month ago maybe
Jan 30 15:24:35 <jeep8790>	i love Fury so goddamn much
Jan 30 15:24:40 <Conky>	It was pretty good, not my cup of tea though
Jan 30 15:25:03 <jeep8790>	its great when the best part of your war movie doesnt involve any combat at all
Jan 30 15:25:14 <Conky>	I know too much about German WWII tactics to love that movie haha
Jan 30 15:25:30 <Aryanne>	http://i.imgur.com/9zwh2vJ.jpg jeep8790 
Jan 30 15:25:31 <Conky>	what part?
Jan 30 15:25:45 <iocaineP>	Aryanne, america.jpg
Jan 30 15:25:45 <jeep8790>	as one review pointed out too its more of a horror movie in the backdrop of ww2
Jan 30 15:25:45 <Conky>	Wow Shotgun marriage literally
Jan 30 15:25:59 <jeep8790>	when they were in the german woman's house
Jan 30 15:26:03 <Conky>	Heh that's interesting
Jan 30 15:26:15 <Conky>	It's certainly no historical reenactment haha
Jan 30 15:26:20 <jeep8790>	but
Jan 30 15:26:20 <jeep8790>	it
Jan 30 15:26:25 <jeep8790>	kinda was pretty good on that too
Jan 30 15:26:41 <Conky>	Oh yeah, that was a good scene
Jan 30 15:27:07 <Conky>	It wasn't terribly inaccurate, just the germans being mentally retarded and shooting like stormtroopers haha
Jan 30 15:27:23 <jeep8790>	well yeah the final thing was kinda
Jan 30 15:27:24 <jeep8790>	like
Jan 30 15:27:25 <jeep8790>	why
Jan 30 15:27:25 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	http://i.imgur.com/cIOs18p.png
Jan 30 15:27:29 <jeep8790>	i mean it wasnt bad
Jan 30 15:27:36 <Conky>	RIP Twi naga
Jan 30 15:27:37 <jeep8790>	it just wasnt the rest of the movie before that
Jan 30 15:27:43 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	No, I did the killing
Jan 30 15:27:49 <Conky>	I did like it though
Jan 30 15:28:23 <jeep8790>	http://i.imgur.com/huQlobx.jpg
Jan 30 15:28:24 <Conky>	Just it became more of an action movie towards the end than I generally like.
Jan 30 15:28:48 <jeep8790>	yeah and it was easily the worst part
Jan 30 15:28:51 <jeep8790>	not bad
Jan 30 15:28:56 <jeep8790>	just in comparison to everything else
Jan 30 15:29:06 <Conky>	Man I wish zombie waifu would try to eat me
Jan 30 15:29:13 <Conky>	Thus starting our tale of love and heartbreak
Jan 30 15:29:22 <jeep8790>	but honestly the kid SS sparing whats his face when he was hiding under the tank nearly redeemed it
Jan 30 15:29:43 <jeep8790>	that was a great touch
Jan 30 15:29:53 <Conky>	I would have liked that part more if the tank crew hadn't slaughtered like 100 of the german kids comrades
Jan 30 15:30:15 <jeep8790>	pls
Jan 30 15:30:21 <Conky>	I mean there's a difference between some of your allies dying in combat and a goddamned slaughter
Jan 30 15:30:29 <jeep8790>	newbie still didnt kill the kids even when he saw his own men die
Jan 30 15:30:36 <jeep8790>	*people
Jan 30 15:30:53 <jeep8790>	the point was to show that mercy is a thing i guess
Jan 30 15:30:54 <jeep8790>	or
Jan 30 15:30:58 <jeep8790>	i dont know how to say it
Jan 30 15:31:08 <Conky>	All I mean is if it wasn't for the silly action part of it it would have made that part meaningful, to me it was ridiculous
Jan 30 15:31:14 <Conky>	yeah I know
Jan 30 15:31:49 <Conky>	but the german kid had like half of his group get killed by a few men, it's not like they lost 4 guys and the americans lost 4 guys so "Oh war is war"
Jan 30 15:31:53 <Conky>	It was a dmaned slaughter
Jan 30 15:32:12 <jeep8790>	k
Jan 30 15:32:24 <Conky>	surely he had some friends amongst the dead, I just couldn't like that scene because it seemed so slapped on
Jan 30 15:33:02 <Conky>	Like the movie though 7.3/10 God bless

Jan 30 20:31:10 <Trips>	what kb
Jan 30 20:31:14 <Trips>	tell me
Jan 30 20:31:27 <Conky>	But yeah building my computer was really fun and rewarding, got really excited picking out parts and making it mine 
Jan 30 20:31:55 <Conky>	I spent so much time researching what to buy just because it was so fun planning to build it
Jan 30 20:31:57 <Trips>	actually just tell me all the things
Jan 30 20:32:02 <Trips>	I'm in that stage right now
Jan 30 20:32:11 <Trips>	just theorycrafting and living in my imagination most of the time
Jan 30 20:32:40 <Conky>	That's the best stage
Jan 30 20:33:03 <Seal>	Trips: http://www.logicalincrements.com/ http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc
Jan 30 20:33:06 <Trips>	well I imagine the best stage is when u actually get everything running
Jan 30 20:33:20 <Trips>	those are very helpful links seal thank u
Jan 30 20:33:25 <Trips>	but I am already aware of them :B
Jan 30 20:33:39 <Conky>	I'm the kinda person who when I make or buy something I use it to the fullest extent, so I'mma use this computer until it's obsolete or until it explodes
Jan 30 20:35:18 <Conky>	Although really for my uses all I need to do to keep it living into the future is get a new graphics card and some more raam maybe a new cpu, I bought a really good mobo and psu so those will be relevant for probly like 10 years
Jan 30 20:35:31 <Conky>	Never skimp on the mobo, everyone always does
Jan 30 20:35:58 <Conky>	I mean unless cost is a large issue, then by all mean SKIMP ON EVERYTHING
Jan 30 20:36:02 <Trips>	I'm not really planning on skimping on anything, I've always had cheap and/or hand-me-downs and I want a nice computer for the first time in like 20 years

Jan 30 20:36:40 <Trips>	how are u
Jan 30 20:36:57 <Conky>	yeah that's what I did, upgraded from a shared family computer when I was like 16 to a meh laptop had that for like 3 years and ran it into the ground, made my own pc and never looked back

Jan 30 20:37:14 <Seal>	Conky: unless the cpu mount on the mobo ends up out of date

Jan 30 20:37:18 <RariBot>	Gummy775, please enjoy the following image albums http://imgur.com/a/9lbjH http://imgur.com/a/fyPU1
Jan 30 20:37:20 <Conky>	A little bit of routine maintenance and it will last me 5+ years
Jan 30 20:37:30 <Trips>	my last 3 computers have been secondhand laptops and they've all been just terrible
Jan 30 20:37:42 <Conky>	Yeah but even then it'll be a while
Jan 30 20:37:53 <Gummy775>	Laptops are disposable purchases
Jan 30 20:37:56 <Trips>	this current one is a "gaming" laptop from 2010-ish and it is completely incapable of doing anything anymore

Jan 30 20:38:25 <Conky>	Laptops usually have a pretty short life span if they're under heavy use
Jan 30 20:38:25 <Gummy775>	Coke pone is funny :D
Jan 30 20:38:45 <Trips>	thanks for the dutch link raribot
Jan 30 20:38:53 <Conky>	I mean cleaning and maintaining them is generally just not worth the pain in the ass since most pre built computers are a nightmare to take apart
Jan 30 20:39:01 <Gummy775>	The Power plug usually wares out first then you gotta replace the whole mother board since they won't replace the single port :S
Jan 30 20:39:23 <iocaineP>	or you desolder it and directly solder the cable in
Jan 30 20:39:28 <Gummy775>	Ha
Jan 30 20:39:29 <Conky>	the captain goes done with the whole ship the second a screw is loose
Jan 30 20:39:29 <Trips>	http://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/G72Gx/ in English this time
Jan 30 20:39:52 <Trips>	it's getting pumped full of .22 and .30-30 the second my build is finished
Jan 30 20:39:55 <Gummy775>	My Network card blew on my Netbook. So it's a piece of nothing now :P

Jan 31 04:41:53 <Vidya>	Although, that along with the fact that I have to breathe heavy to get as much air as I would normally tells me that my throat's probably closed.
Jan 31 04:43:13 <Vidya>	Maybe this is what mum meant when she said people have been dying.
Jan 31 04:43:51 <DrChandra>	.....what's going oooooon ._.
Jan 31 04:44:27 <Vidya>	Seems to be a throat infection, hurts to talk, breathe, swallow and cough.
Jan 31 04:45:21 <Vidya>	And of course, the former 3 irritate my throat, which means that if I wasn't coughing, I'll end up coughing because my throat got irritated.

Jan 31 04:47:18 <jeroknite>	Do you have any medicine in the house now?
Jan 31 04:48:34 <Vidya>	Been treating it all day with honey throat loszenges, hot tea(sweetened, no additives), CVS Pharmacy brand chloraseptic and of course, keeping my mouth shut.
Jan 31 04:48:52 <jeroknite>	Do you have ibuprofin?
Jan 31 04:49:05 <jeroknite>	That might reduce any swelling in your throat
Jan 31 04:49:41 <Vidya>	Haven't taken it yet. But now that my throat just clogged with mucus I'm fucking scared the pill will get caught.
Jan 31 04:50:26 <jeroknite>	See if you can cough that out, then try to take the pill
Jan 31 04:50:40 <jeroknite>	If it does feel stuck, drink more water
Jan 31 04:50:42 <jeroknite>	OR
Jan 31 04:50:55 <jeroknite>	Crush pill  and mix with a drink
Jan 31 04:51:24 <jeroknite>	You can crush pills between two spoons
Jan 31 04:51:42 <jeroknite>	And if you have honey, that will mask most of the taste

Jan 31 04:52:03 <Vidya>	Not sure if there's more.
Jan 31 04:53:30 <Vidya>	But yeah, I'll find where the pills are stashed, crush 2 up and put it in some tea.

Jan 31 06:21:55 <jeroknite>	D:
Jan 31 06:22:03 <jeroknite>	Allocate more sheep
Jan 31 06:22:28 <Vidya>	Get a 970
Jan 31 06:22:28 <Princess_Pwny>	My card is 2GB, windows is providing another 2GB of system memory but it does not use any of that
Jan 31 06:22:29 <Vidya>	Oh wait

Jan 31 06:23:19 <Vidya>	But yeah, getting a low vram card was one of the worst mistakes I've made with this build
Jan 31 06:23:19 <jeroknite>	That should help
Jan 31 06:23:56 <Princess_Pwny>	Ehh, I did not think it would be an issue
Jan 31 06:23:59 <Princess_Pwny>	Nor should it be
Jan 31 06:24:04 <Princess_Pwny>	With fucking minecraft
Jan 31 06:24:20 <Vidya>	Think someone left on a redstone contraption?

Jan 31 06:24:51 <Princess_Pwny>	With pleanty of mods, but I've had this issue with almost any modded playthrough since forever
Jan 31 06:25:20 <Vidya>	Yeah, it's odd that 2 gigs of VRAM is suddenly weaksauce in 2015
Jan 31 06:26:23 <Princess_Pwny>	Plus It's minecraft
Jan 31 06:26:52 <Princess_Pwny>	why does it need over 1GB of vmem and why does it just crash instead of using system provided video memory
Jan 31 06:28:36 <Vidya>	idunnolol
Jan 31 06:29:22 <Vidya>	I'm going to go lie(or rather recline) down for a bit, maybe get a tiny bit of shuteye.

Feb 01 05:21:22 <Vidya>	But yeah, I'd probably do something stupid like get one of the 4s and get it modified to SD4 spec.
Feb 01 05:21:42 <Vidya>	Or rather just buy an SD4 and lift it in.
Feb 01 05:22:29 <Trips>	although if I had a choice I'd get a second gen MR2 a thousand times before any Fiero
Feb 01 05:22:44 <Vidya>	Same.

Feb 01 05:25:57 <Vidya>	but tripsu
Feb 01 05:26:01 <Vidya>	it's a 454
Feb 01 05:26:29 <Vidya>	also it was the one just before vettes went to complete garbage
Feb 01 05:27:24 <Trips>	yeah if you want to feel what a 454 is like with 150 hp
Feb 01 05:29:22 <Vidya>	Oh shit
Feb 01 05:29:26 <Vidya>	I forgot about that
Feb 01 05:29:39 <Vidya>	71's the year they were actually good, right?
Feb 01 05:30:30 <Trips>	I'd say anything from 70-84 is a complete waste
Feb 01 05:30:43 <Trips>	regardless of make or model
Feb 01 05:31:28 <Trips>	1970 is when the government came down hard on emissions and basically neutered most performance vehicles
Feb 01 05:32:35 <Vidya>	Freedom, amirite?
Feb 01 05:37:52 <jeroknite>	Yeah it sure is terrible that the government made pollution not as bad

Feb 01 05:42:42 <Vidya>	My whole problem is that, okay, apply it to normal cars, but for fuck's sake 454 Vettes and shit like that are fucking coal burners even with all of the eco bullshit.

Feb 01 05:45:29 <Trips>	kinda shit unless u feel like paying a million bux for diesel

Feb 01 07:09:08 <Trips>	what a great question
Feb 01 07:09:09 <jeroknite>	The creepy thing about it's arms, is they don't have joints
Feb 01 07:09:26 <jeroknite>	They just move along the surface of the body
Feb 01 07:10:01 <jeroknite>	So is there a bone pushing against the skin from the inside?
Feb 01 07:11:09 <Trips>	well the first thing u need to understand is that kirby was originally a placeholder sprite
Feb 01 07:11:28 <Trips>	and from there you can just attribute everything to laziness and/or "who cares"

Feb 01 07:41:50 <Dr_Chandra_s>	He's such a prick. Every time he talks to me it feels so smug and condescending
Feb 01 07:42:52 <Dr_Chandra_s>	I've hated him ever since I we had a reasonable debate about Microsoft and the xbox, it was mostly civil and we were both providing good points and he ruins it all by calling me a fanboy
Feb 01 07:43:51 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Like, can we seriously not have a mature debate without name calling?
Feb 01 07:44:06 <Dr_Chandra_s>	Even the way he types. Its so blunt and rude.

Feb 01 19:27:20 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	So, I know that there's a lot of people who diet instead of exercising because exercising = effort
Feb 01 19:27:24 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	and it doesn't really work.
Feb 01 19:27:34 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	But would it work if I just exercise without dieting?
Feb 01 19:27:38 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Because I like my food.
Feb 01 19:27:54 <sprankton>	If you eat the same amount of food as before, sure
Feb 01 19:28:10 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	So I shouldn't exercise and eat twice as much food to celebrate?
Feb 01 19:28:31 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	"I just ran two miles.  Time for a cake."
Feb 01 19:28:51 <sprankton>	Most people eat more when they exercise unless they consciously avoid it
Feb 01 19:28:55 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	ah
Feb 01 19:28:58 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	wel
Feb 01 19:28:59 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	l
Feb 01 19:29:01 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	that's dumb
Feb 01 19:29:10 <sprankton>	That's evolution
Feb 01 19:29:22 <iocaineP>	Fapping counts as exercise
Feb 01 19:29:22 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	evolution is dumb
Feb 01 19:29:25 <sprankton>	Burn more calories; crave more food
Feb 01 19:29:29 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Iocaine, I know.
Feb 01 19:29:35 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	That's why I'm exercising right now.
Feb 01 19:29:40 <Seal>	Princess_Twi`Naga_s: exercising doesn't burn that many calories compared to just eating less
Feb 01 19:29:43 <iocaineP>	It makes me hungry :c
Feb 01 19:29:56 *	Aryanne giggles Seal 
Feb 01 19:30:15 <iocaineP>	eating less doesn't burn any calories
Feb 01 19:30:26 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	But keeping track of all the food I eat seems difficult and unreliable.

Feb 01 19:30:34 <iocaineP>	Eating celery burns shittons
Feb 01 19:30:42 *	Seal explodes
Feb 01 19:30:59 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	I think that's a myth, but idk enough about food/body science to dispute it.
Feb 01 19:31:14 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	I too have heard that celery is negative calories.
Feb 01 19:31:29 <Seal>	iocaineP: eating less doesn't burn calories but you burn calories by being alive
Feb 01 19:31:35 <iocaineP>	true
Feb 01 19:31:37 <Seal>	also
Feb 01 19:31:40 <Seal>	this fuckin guy
Feb 01 19:31:44 <iocaineP>	Sit outside in the cold, burn calories
Feb 01 19:31:44 <Seal>	his name is "Dont'a"
Feb 01 19:31:53 <Seal>	iocaineP: sit anywhere, burn calories
Feb 01 19:31:58 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Also,
Feb 01 19:32:00 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	what seal meant
Feb 01 19:32:13 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Is that eating less reduces how many calories you take in
Feb 01 19:32:19 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	so it's not like it's burning more
Feb 01 19:32:21 <iocaineP>	Forcing your body to burn fat
Feb 01 19:32:25 <iocaineP>	?
Feb 01 19:32:25 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	it's making more calories not exist.
Feb 01 19:32:37 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	which is even better
Feb 01 19:32:41 <iocaineP>	Yeah
Feb 01 19:32:41 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	probably
Feb 01 19:32:54 <iocaineP>	dieting is easier than exercise if you're not picky or lazy or broke
Feb 01 19:33:01 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	yeah
Feb 01 19:33:06 <Trips>	dieting is super easy when you're broke
Feb 01 19:33:09 <Trips>	you can't afford food

Feb 01 19:33:21 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	I'd just make ramen and shit
Feb 01 19:33:22 <iocaineP>	spinach
Feb 01 19:33:26 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	I'd skip meals because the pantry was empty
Feb 01 19:33:27 <iocaineP>	bags of spinach

Feb 01 23:59:46 <topkekbestkek>	fug u den
Feb 01 23:59:46 <RainbowPonySemen>	last time i used cccleaner it got rid of all my browsing history and i cried 
Feb 01 23:59:47 <RisenLM>	but that's not exactly safe
Feb 01 23:59:54 <topkekbestkek>	you can disable that dude
Feb 02 00:00:03 <RisenLM>	Managed to check the hardware on the bios anyway, and everything else was fine.
Feb 02 00:00:03 <Trips>	<RisenLM> Almost got my desktop finished, by the power supply won't plug into my motherboard, so I need a new one :I
Feb 02 00:00:04 <Trips>	hi
Feb 02 00:00:04 <topkekbestkek>	choose what you want it to remove
Feb 02 00:00:15 <RisenLM>	yes hello Trips
Feb 02 00:00:18 <Trips>	I have a corsair cx750
Feb 02 00:00:22 <Trips>	u want
Feb 02 00:00:34 <kwunicorn>	butts
Feb 02 00:00:44 <topkekbestkek>	only tree fiddy
Feb 02 00:00:44 <RisenLM>	Maybe. Only really need a 600 though.
Feb 02 00:00:48 <Vidya>	I choose for it to remove kebab
Feb 02 00:00:56 <topkekbestkek>	NICE MEMING
Feb 02 00:00:57 <RisenLM>	This nice monitor has been here for a week now, taunting me
Feb 02 00:01:04 <topkekbestkek>	lol
Feb 02 00:01:16 <RisenLM>	Tried dual-screen with my laptop but my shitty mobility ATI doesn't like that
Feb 02 00:01:18 <topkekbestkek>	did you buy it without knowing if it would work
Feb 02 00:01:29 <topkekbestkek>	or what
Feb 02 00:01:32 <Trips>	yeah but u would have overhead
Feb 02 00:01:53 <Trips>	also it is literally brand new as I have never turned it on or put power thru it
Feb 02 00:01:53 <RisenLM>	I spose. Biggest drain is the 280X though, and alltogether it's only like 433W as of now?
Feb 02 00:02:37 <RisenLM>	Whatchoo want fer it? Or PM if you prefer
Feb 02 00:02:50 <Trips>	60 bux I accept payment in the form of steam games
Feb 02 00:03:05 <topkekbestkek>	if a guy digitally designed a sex toy with his hands on a computer, and it gets turned into a mold and then into a physical sex toy and you get off with it, are you getting an indirect hand job from a guy
Feb 02 00:03:18 <iocaineP>	yes
Feb 02 00:03:20 <Trips>	what a profound thought
Feb 02 00:03:27 <Trips>	truly you are one of the great thinkers of our time
Feb 02 00:03:35 <topkekbestkek>	also dicks
Feb 02 00:03:42 <RisenLM>	Okay yeah I'd probably do that
Feb 02 00:03:47 <iocaineP>	aren't they great?
Feb 02 00:03:52 <RisenLM>	Need to setup this return too
Feb 02 00:03:54 <topkekbestkek>	just the horse ones
Feb 02 00:03:56 <topkekbestkek>	and maybe deer

Feb 02 00:04:14 <topkekbestkek>	have you guys read the new comica
Feb 02 00:04:17 <RisenLM>	Paypal a shit so Steam might be the viable option
Feb 02 00:04:18 <topkekbestkek>	with the deer elves
Feb 02 00:04:24 <RisenLM>	Why do you need my bank information you shitlords
Feb 02 00:04:29 <Trips>	fwiw I'm getting rid of it because I rethinking my own build and 750W is just not enough
Feb 02 00:04:39 <Trips>	and I'd probably spend the money on steam games anyway so win-win
Feb 02 00:04:58 <iocaineP>	RisenLM, Paypal can't see the name attached to the bank account though
Feb 02 00:05:21 <topkekbestkek>	so we can serve you better
Feb 02 00:05:23 <RisenLM>	Still, shouldn't even need to provide it. I'd be grandfathered in if I could be assed to remember my old account info
Feb 02 00:05:39 <AttackTheMoon>	hur bur
Feb 02 00:05:45 <Trips>	I can't utilize paypal anyway since all the bank accounts that were associated with my account no longer exist
Feb 02 00:05:55 <RainbowPonySemen>	u don't need a bank account to use paypal
Feb 02 00:05:57 <Trips>	and I gotta wait for payday to set up a new one :B
Feb 02 00:05:59 <RainbowPonySemen>	they bug you for it a lot
Feb 02 00:06:06 <RainbowPonySemen>	but you really only need a debit/credit card attached to it 
Feb 02 00:06:08 <Trips>	well I don't have a money card of any kind either
Feb 02 00:06:08 <RisenLM>	I literally get rejected for every payment
Feb 02 00:06:14 <RisenLM>	Have to provide an account now
Feb 02 00:06:19 <RainbowPonySemen>	are you sure
Feb 02 00:06:24 <RisenLM>	Tried everything else
Feb 02 00:06:29 <RisenLM>	Multiple cards
Feb 02 00:06:36 <RainbowPonySemen>	what are you
Feb 02 00:06:37 <topkekbestkek>	if you prove your radicalness they'll give you good boy points

Feb 02 00:06:45 <RisenLM>	Was just trying to use it on Etsy
Feb 02 00:07:15 <RainbowPonySemen>	i use my paypal account all the time on everything and it doesn't have a bank acc attached
Feb 02 00:07:35 <RainbowPonySemen>	and i made a secondary one like a month ago with just a prepaid card 
Feb 02 00:07:38 <AttackTheMoon>	paypal is hitler
Feb 02 00:07:58 <Trips>	shiterally litler
Feb 02 00:08:06 <AttackTheMoon>	someone pay attention to me
Feb 02 00:08:17 <RisenLM>	I'll just stick to Amazon Payments or Google Wallet etc.
Feb 02 00:08:20 *	kwunicorn stares at AttackTheMoon 
Feb 02 00:08:24 <Trips>	can u just straight up send money to someone's steam account
Feb 02 00:08:25 *	AttackTheMoon waves
Feb 02 00:08:29 <Trips>	I wonder
Feb 02 00:08:30 <topkekbestkek>	i like paypal
Feb 02 00:08:32 <RainbowPonySemen>	no
Feb 02 00:08:34 <RisenLM>	I don't think so
Feb 02 00:08:36 <RainbowPonySemen>	you can't
Feb 02 00:08:38 <topkekbestkek>	it's easy
Feb 02 00:08:38 <Trips>	I didn't think so either
Feb 02 00:08:38 <RisenLM>	At one point potentially
Feb 02 00:08:41 <RainbowPonySemen>	but they can list an item on the market
Feb 02 00:08:43 <RainbowPonySemen>	for like 50 dollars
Feb 02 00:08:46 <RainbowPonySemen>	and you can buy it 
Feb 02 00:08:50 <iocaineP>	aha
Feb 02 00:08:53 <RisenLM>	Bit of a loss for that
Feb 02 00:09:01 <topkekbestkek>	i printed out a target of hitler to shoot nerf guns at
Feb 02 00:09:02 <iocaineP>	What about gift cards
Feb 02 00:09:02 <topkekbestkek>	it's fun
Feb 02 00:09:10 <iocaineP>	That's not direct though
Feb 02 00:09:14 <RainbowPonySemen>	or you could buy a steam gift card and give em the code yeah
Feb 02 00:09:19 <topkekbestkek>	ye
Feb 02 00:09:20 <topkekbestkek>	yeh
Feb 02 00:09:23 <topkekbestkek>	yeahaha

Feb 02 00:11:33 <Trips>	weak
Feb 02 00:11:44 <RisenLM>	In their defense, you're making money in a way that wasn't securely feasible before
Feb 02 00:11:56 <iocaineP>	He was just checking the fee
Feb 02 00:12:01 <Trips>	or u could just buy the games I want I guess
Feb 02 00:12:16 <Trips>	don't think there's a fee for that
Feb 02 00:12:33 <iocaineP>	a much smaller one if any
Feb 02 00:12:43 <RisenLM>	Nah, gifts are flat rate
Feb 02 00:12:49 <iocaineP>	But yeah I don't think there is one either, it would deter sales
Feb 02 00:12:52 <RisenLM>	rather, no additional fees
Feb 02 00:12:59 <topkekbestkek>	you should give me all the money
Feb 02 00:13:06 <topkekbestkek>	because i am a cool guy
Feb 02 00:13:13 <RisenLM>	I can do that, or gift cards. Your choice. Other options may also be available.
Feb 02 00:13:20 <iocaineP>	be a cool gay and earn your own

Feb 02 00:13:52 <AttackTheMoon>	link
Feb 02 00:13:55 <Trips>	it would be probably less convenient to buy & gift the games cause there'd be like 5 of them
Feb 02 00:13:57 <topkekbestkek>	no one wants to see my fat ass
Feb 02 00:14:00 <Trips>	but I dunnooooo

Feb 02 00:30:48 <topkekbestkek>	at least it was only $200
Feb 02 00:30:54 <iocaineP>	Trips, ikr
Feb 02 00:30:55 <AttackTheMoon>	i want a mac comp
Feb 02 00:30:57 <Trips>	soon my big sexy desktop will be done
Feb 02 00:31:06 <iocaineP>	how soon
Feb 02 00:31:07 <Trips>	and I'll actually be able to run 3d games and shit
Feb 02 00:31:10 <Trips>	this year
Feb 02 00:31:15 <topkekbestkek>	i don't think i could ever use an expensive laptop
Feb 02 00:31:19 <iocaineP>	heh
Feb 02 00:31:22 <topkekbestkek>	i'd be too scared of breaking it
Feb 02 00:31:23 <Trips>	should be done by May or so
Feb 02 00:31:28 <iocaineP>	Nah that's the best part
Feb 02 00:31:38 <iocaineP>	The expensive ones are built like tanks if you shop right
Feb 02 00:31:50 <iocaineP>	Lenovo
Feb 02 00:32:02 <kwunicorn>	I'll touch ur butt nerd
Feb 02 00:32:12 <iocaineP>	:3
Feb 02 00:32:22 <Trips>	i7 + R9 290X (unless something way better comes out before summer; 300 series?)
Feb 02 00:32:50 <Trips>	and delicious water cooling
Feb 02 00:32:50 <topkekbestkek>	can i touch your butt after
Feb 02 00:32:55 <iocaineP>	psh
Feb 02 00:33:40 <iocaineP>	I would love to have a watercooled setup but it feels like overkill
Feb 02 00:33:41 <iocaineP>	quiet though
Feb 02 00:34:00 <Trips>	well I'm gunna OC for certain
Feb 02 00:34:09 <Trips>	and might Crossfire eventually
Feb 02 00:34:13 <Trips>	so it would be a good idea
Feb 02 00:34:22 <iocaineP>	crossfiring 290Xs?
Feb 02 00:34:27 <iocaineP>	Is that 4 GPUs?
Feb 02 00:34:32 <Trips>	no, it's two
Feb 02 00:34:38 <Trips>	you're thinking of the 295X2 I think
Feb 02 00:34:41 <iocaineP>	ahh
Feb 02 00:34:54 <topkekbestkek>	i'm going to beb now
Feb 02 00:35:00 <topkekbestkek>	have a nice night gammies
Feb 02 00:35:01 <iocaineP>	well wtf does the X mean on its own?
Feb 02 00:35:01 <Trips>	have fun
Feb 02 00:35:24 <Trips>	XTREME GRAPHICS PERFORMANCE
Feb 02 00:35:25 <Trips>	I dunno
Feb 02 00:35:35 <iocaineP>	night
Feb 02 00:35:42 <topkekbestkek>	i will be praying to the computer gods for your software to run bug-free and your hardware to stay mounted

Feb 02 00:36:40 *	topkekbestkek has quit (Quit: Web client closed)
Feb 02 00:36:50 <Trips>	also the only difference I can see between the 290 and 290X is the X is slightly better
Feb 02 00:36:56 <Trips>	so no idea

Feb 02 00:40:16 <RisenLM>	That's what the X stands for, at least in the case of AMD
Feb 02 00:40:34 <iocaineP>	:O
Feb 02 00:40:39 <iocaineP>	awesome
Feb 02 00:40:44 <RisenLM>	and it's Dutch because I think that's where the server is hosted
Feb 02 00:40:56 <RisenLM>	relative geographically
Feb 02 00:41:19 <iocaineP>	buh
Feb 02 00:41:59 <Trips>	aha
Feb 02 00:42:35 <RisenLM>	I didn't plan to overlock, but there was a sale on a Sapphire 280X cheaper than a 280 at the time
Feb 02 00:42:41 <RisenLM>	still don't plan to, rather
Feb 02 00:43:27 <Trips>	overclock all the things
Feb 02 00:44:15 <kwunicorn>	overclock ur dick
Feb 02 00:46:35 <iocaineP>	lewd
Feb 02 00:47:16 <Conky>	There's no real reason to overclock other than just for shits to see what you can get at your maxed stable state, I mean you can OC for minor benefits if you really don't give a shit about running your card down 5 times faster than normal I guess.
Feb 02 00:48:00 <Conky>	Obviously not 5 times as hard on it if it's an overclocked specific model but still runs it harder than you should
Feb 02 00:48:14 <iocaineP>	If you're mining dogecoin
Feb 02 00:48:27 <iocaineP>	for those sweet gains
Feb 02 00:48:47 <Conky>	I meanif money's not an issue about your gpu just get a better card, or another card rather than melting it within a year or two

Feb 02 00:55:53 <RainbowPonySemen>	just
Feb 02 00:55:55 <RainbowPonySemen>	startx
Feb 02 00:56:06 <RainbowPonySemen>	started
Feb 02 00:56:25 <Trips>	lucky ;-;
Feb 02 00:56:41 <Conky>	Been snowing since october, ready for change
Feb 02 00:56:54 <Coggler>	Move here.
Feb 02 00:57:02 <Coggler>	What even is snow
Feb 02 00:57:06 <Conky>	Hah, I'd move to Vancouver maybe 
Feb 02 00:57:08 <RainbowPonySemen>	its shit
Feb 02 00:57:13 <RainbowPonySemen>	that i need to shovel tomorw
Feb 02 00:57:25 <RisenLM>	Snow this weekend. No shovel guys until tomorrow. Hard to walk to the office to pay rent.
Feb 02 00:57:34 <Conky>	shoveling snow is good for you.
Feb 02 00:57:39 <Trips>	funny, adult swim just aired a bump attempting to ban snow
Feb 02 00:57:41 <RainbowPonySemen>	u know whats better 
Feb 02 00:57:42 <RainbowPonySemen>	for me 
Feb 02 00:57:44 <RainbowPonySemen>	than that
Feb 02 00:57:52 <RainbowPonySemen>	not shoveling snow
Feb 02 00:57:54 <RainbowPonySemen>	thats what
Feb 02 00:57:58 <Conky>	Besides if you have a snow blower it's plain good fun
Feb 02 00:58:01 <RisenLM>	build a snowblower
Feb 02 00:58:26 <Conky>	Man if I ever get rich I want my own personal Zamboni
Feb 02 00:58:30 <Coggler>	just blow the snow
Feb 02 00:58:39 <RainbowPonySemen>	i'm good at blowing things
Feb 02 00:58:54 <Conky>	Just pour hot water on the snow, to melt it, then when the water freezes pour more hot water on the ice
Feb 02 00:59:21 <RisenLM>	Won't the hot water just instantly freeze
Feb 02 00:59:29 <Conky>	Depends how cold it is
Feb 02 00:59:51 <Conky>	Some days when it's real cold you can drop boiling water from waist height and it freezes before it hits the ground
Feb 02 00:59:54 <Conky>	it's good fun
Feb 02 01:01:01 <Conky>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S1M4qDwj10
Feb 02 01:01:01 <RariBot>	Boiling Water Freezes before it hits the Ground. | 501 | 100% | 0:00:20
Feb 02 01:02:17 <Conky>	Man that raises a good question if you piss when it's that cold will it freeze before hitting the ground
Feb 02 01:02:40 <Conky>	Usually when you pee it stays in a solid stream though so it'd probably have to be like -60 for that to happen
Feb 02 01:02:46 <bitchcakes>	would u be willing to have frostbitten balls
Feb 02 01:02:46 <iocaineP>	Yeah
Feb 02 01:02:53 <iocaineP>	and 'cause it's not boiling
Feb 02 01:03:42 <Trips>	omg its snowing here too >w<
Feb 02 01:03:53 <Conky>	-50 celsius though christ that's insane, only seen like -45
Feb 02 01:04:14 <Trips>	it got to nearly -40 here a few weeks ago x_x
Feb 02 01:04:25 <bitchcakes>	http://i.imgur.com/atKNEo6.png
Feb 02 01:04:27 <bitchcakes>	its learning
Feb 02 01:04:27 <Conky>	One of my friends works in the NorthWest Territories right now, got to like -55 celsius for him one day
Feb 02 01:04:47 <Conky>	TFW your liquid gas starts to freeze over and you can't run your fireplace
Feb 02 01:05:11 <iocaineP>	:I
Feb 02 01:05:13 <Conky>	it didn't actually but pretty close to the temperature
Feb 02 01:05:44 <iocaineP>	I was watching a shitty home and garden show wherea guy was trying to move to Svalbard.. most places didn't have electricity
Feb 02 01:06:24 <Trips>	that sucks, Svalbard would be a cool place to live
Feb 02 01:06:25 <Conky>	not too surprising that's a bit far away from supply lines
Feb 02 01:06:25 <iocaineP>	How good of insulation would you need to have
Feb 02 01:06:31 <Trips>	as long as u had internet I guess
Feb 02 01:06:32 <iocaineP>	or stoves
Feb 02 01:06:36 <iocaineP>	no, no utilities

Feb 02 01:07:06 <Trips>	wow what a fucking link
Feb 02 01:07:07 <iocaineP>	I'd work there
Feb 02 01:07:08 <Trips>	is that even necessary
Feb 02 01:07:14 <iocaineP>	nope
Feb 02 01:07:22 <Conky>	Yeah I always get amazed at the house design here, need a house that stays warm in -40 and cool in +40 fucking magic I guess
Feb 02 01:07:29 <Conky>	although electricity helps
Feb 02 01:07:39 <iocaineP>	I think they might've generated folders based on the file's hash or something
Feb 02 01:08:04 <Conky>	Atleast they don't need fans for their computers
Feb 02 01:08:23 <iocaineP>	You can't put it outside though, get water dripping off your heatsinks
Feb 02 01:08:47 <Conky>	And no need for a fridge when you have a bucket and access to outside
Feb 02 01:08:52 <iocaineP>	You could easily build a little humidity controlled room for it though
Feb 02 01:10:01 <iocaineP>	...if you had electricity
Feb 02 01:10:17 <iocaineP>	assuming you would since computer
Feb 02 01:10:26 <Conky>	Seriously there's something really great about having beers outside when ice fishing or sitting around a fire and thinking "Hmm I need this beer to stay cold" then realising there's literally nothing but snow in all directions so you just put it on the ground

Feb 02 01:11:58 <Conky>	Even when I always go camping when we take beer or anything we want cold just put it in the lake and make a little rock outcrop around it to keep the water moving but no room for them to escape
Feb 02 01:12:09 <Coggler>	I miss that about camping
Feb 02 01:12:11 <Conky>	Nature is both a total cunt and a bro

Feb 02 01:13:21 <Trips>	what is the outdoors
Feb 02 01:13:30 <RisenLM>	Camping is a bad time for me
Feb 02 01:13:35 <Conky>	My brother cousin and I spent like 4 days moving rocks around and shit to capture some water that was moving water overtop of smooth rock and craft our own hot spring-esque hot tub on the island we found.
Feb 02 01:13:40 <Trips>	is it that place with the horrible bright thing up above you all the time
Feb 02 01:13:42 <Coggler>	I live right near a river type dealie. It's walking distance. But no good camping for a little ways.

Feb 02 01:15:07 <Coggler>	The last time I went camping, we got these little blocks you throw into the fire and it makes the flames change color.
Feb 02 01:15:17 <RainbowPonySemen>	i love those omg 
Feb 02 01:15:24 <iocaineP>	Hiking + picnic is more fun than overnight stays IMO but I still love camping
Feb 02 01:15:30 <kwulhu>	I smoke those
Feb 02 01:15:44 <Conky>	every year I go out with a few friends, we rent kayaks and a canoe to carry our gear, we spend 2-3 days travelling around rivers and crossing channels staying at random islands for the night until we get to our usual camp spot, just an island we really like, stay there for a few days then go home the opposite way to loop back around

Feb 02 01:16:21 <kwulhu>	does the island have wifi?
Feb 02 01:16:33 <Conky>	there's something like 10,000 little islands all along the Bay connected by rivers and channels, probably only seen 500 of them by now
Feb 02 01:16:33 <Coggler>	I went to a girls camp every year for like 7 years. One year we all got kayaks and went around in this giant lake.
Feb 02 01:16:50 <Coggler>	We ended up tipping each other over using our paddles, and then one of us found a dead fish floating so we'd fling it into each others kayaks
Feb 02 01:16:59 <Conky>	haha
Feb 02 01:17:02 <RisenLM>	I'll just go white people camping
Feb 02 01:17:07 <Coggler>	Glamping?

Feb 02 01:18:11 <Conky>	Yeah though we just take a shit load of beer with us, go fishing in our kayaks, swim in the cold ass water and be men, it's damned fun.
Feb 02 01:18:54 <Coggler>	omg it's almost fishing season again
Feb 02 01:19:03 <Coggler>	and I'll have a job so I can afford my fishing license

Feb 02 01:24:26 <Conky>	I love seafood but I've actually never been a fan of clams
Feb 02 01:24:28 <Conky>	not sure why
Feb 02 01:24:38 <DrinkiePie>	clams can be weird

Feb 02 01:26:05 <DrinkiePie>	ive never had sushi
Feb 02 01:26:06 <Coggler>	I've only recently grown to appreciate sushi.
Feb 02 01:26:11 <Coggler>	I hated it for a very long time. 
Feb 02 01:26:12 <DrinkiePie>	its hard bc im allergic to sesame seeds
Feb 02 01:26:17 <Coggler>	but now alll of the sudden I LOOOVE it.
Feb 02 01:26:19 <iocaineP>	Ah yeah DrinkiePie 
Feb 02 01:26:20 <Conky>	fish you caught an hour ago and cooked on an open fire and breaded with homemade fish batter is best fish

Feb 02 01:27:26 *	Trips touches butts
Feb 02 01:27:26 <Coggler>	I used to catch a bunch of trout, clean them on site, and then go home and stuff them with butter and garlic and wrap them in foil and throw them on a grill.
Feb 02 01:27:44 *	iocaineP gropes Trips 
Feb 02 01:27:52 <Trips>	lewd :3c
Feb 02 01:27:57 <Conky>	I don't know why but all the like 30+ guys I know who fish all the time share fish batter recipes and shit it's fucking hilarious seeing a bunch of rough and tumble guys saying "dude you just have to try my recipe, you really need the sage in it man, it brings out the flavour"
Feb 02 01:28:03 <Conky>	and shit like that cracks me up
Feb 02 01:28:08 <Coggler>	heeeeee
Feb 02 01:28:10 <Coggler>	that sounds awesome
Feb 02 01:28:10 <Conky>	One day I too will have a recipe
Feb 02 01:28:11 <iocaineP>	<3
Feb 02 01:28:30 <DrinkiePie>	just use lemon juice and basil
Feb 02 01:28:33 <DrinkiePie>	works for most fish I think
Feb 02 01:28:41 <DrinkiePie>	for a light marinade
Feb 02 01:28:47 <Coggler>	I haven't tried many types of fish.
Feb 02 01:28:54 <Conky>	Eh depends on the fish
Feb 02 01:29:11 <Coggler>	The only fish I catch to eat are trout and salmon. Anything else, I don't know if I like it, so I only do catch and release.
Feb 02 01:29:14 <Coggler>	Only keep what I eat.
Feb 02 01:29:32 <Conky>	My favourite fish is pickerel 
Feb 02 01:29:37 <Trips>	I don't really fish but it's a thing to do around here, and there isn't much of that at all
Feb 02 01:29:37 <iocaineP>	Salmon c:
Feb 02 01:29:40 <Coggler>	I want to try bass and bluegill because that's what I most often caught in california. but I don't know if they're as common here...
Feb 02 01:29:41 <Trips>	might have to start
Feb 02 01:29:58 <kwulhu>	I'll tickerel ur pickerel

Feb 02 01:30:44 <Conky>	fishing's fun, I mean it's not like dirtbiking fun, but it's just fun to go hang out with people and fish, it's a good excuse to get together shoot the shit and get some good food out of it
Feb 02 01:30:46 <Coggler>	I'm pretty sure I got it when I visted a few years ago, before I moved.
Feb 02 01:31:10 *	CaptChuckles (webchat@no-ogj.8sa.km5hoh.IP) has joined #Horseplay
Feb 02 01:31:24 <Coggler>	When I lived in Cali and had my car, I'd keep my spare rod and tacklebox in my trunk at all times so if I had a bad work day I could just drive straight to a lake and go fishing for a few hours.
Feb 02 01:31:40 <Conky>	heh, that's cool
Feb 02 01:32:01 <Coggler>	I got my grandpa's old tacklebox for Christmas last year. ;u;
Feb 02 01:32:08 <CaptChuckles>	did that emergency fishing kit include emergency fishing beer?4
Feb 02 01:32:09 <Coggler>	I really hope I have kids so I can pass it on.
Feb 02 01:32:11 <iocaineP>	D'aww
Feb 02 01:32:12 <Conky>	I wish I lived right on the water, feel like going fishing and you have the boat sarted up 30 seconds later

Feb 02 01:33:04 <Conky>	Beer is mandatory for when men are gathered to fish, even if you don't drink beer or nobody drinks beer you still need to have some in case of an emergency
Feb 02 01:33:05 <iocaineP>	bai
Feb 02 01:33:06 <DrinkiePie>	good night RisenLM

Feb 02 01:33:41 <Coggler>	Hmmm this sounds fun.
Feb 02 01:33:52 <CaptChuckles>	Fishing and beer go hand in hand
Feb 02 01:34:00 <kwulhu>	how are you doing?
Feb 02 01:34:01 <Conky>	^
Feb 02 01:34:21 <CaptChuckles>	playing the job hunting/unemployment game
Feb 02 01:34:27 <Trips>	shit sux
Feb 02 01:34:32 <Conky>	I've never even gotten drunk fishing but you gotta have beers
Feb 02 01:34:39 <CaptChuckles>	yerp
Feb 02 01:35:07 <Conky>	now ice fishing you can get fucking drunk as hell, as long as you're sober enough to notice the rod twitching you're fine
Feb 02 01:35:11 <CaptChuckles>	I did get a bite on a position in Australia which'd be cool
Feb 02 01:35:13 <kwulhu>	tfw wired af

Feb 02 01:36:20 <CaptChuckles>	I like both those people!
Feb 02 01:37:12 <DrinkiePie>	im surprised how calm everyone in downtown seattle is
Feb 02 01:37:26 <DrinkiePie>	considering how they all had their hearts literally ripped out
Feb 02 01:37:34 <Coggler>	Yeahhh
Feb 02 01:37:35 <Princess_Pwny>	I like me too!
Feb 02 01:37:36 <Coggler>	that stunk
Feb 02 01:37:41 <Coggler>	My very first time watching an entire football game.
Feb 02 01:37:53 <CaptChuckles>	Well it was a damn good game
Feb 02 01:38:27 <Conky>	I didn't even watch it but I know it was better than last years by about 1000 fold haha
Feb 02 01:38:38 <Coggler>	It was intense
Feb 02 01:38:52 <Coggler>	we had a single person in our huge group that was rooting for the Pats
Feb 02 01:38:58 <Trips>	still proud of the hawks anyway
Feb 02 01:39:03 <Conky>	ahh that one guy
Feb 02 01:39:20 <Coggler>	He had a bet riding on it despite being born and raised in washington :|
Feb 02 01:39:27 <Coggler>	his wife kept screaming "IN YOUR FACE" every time we scored
Feb 02 01:39:30 <Trips>	what a dick
Feb 02 01:39:32 <CaptChuckles>	https://gfycat.com/ZestyVastHamster
Feb 02 01:39:34 <Coggler>	but when he won in the end he just silently left
Feb 02 01:39:37 <DrinkiePie>	do I know this person
Feb 02 01:39:43 <Coggler>	Nope this was all stina's family
Feb 02 01:39:46 <DrinkiePie>	oh ok
Feb 02 01:39:56 <Coggler>	it was weird but fun
Feb 02 01:40:06 <Trips>	also Seahawks fans probably remember when not too long ago when they were like one of the worst teams in the NFL so losing a Super Bowl is not something to get super upset about
Feb 02 01:40:21 <DrinkiePie>	I put money on the seahawks last year
Feb 02 01:40:25 <Coggler>	niceee
Feb 02 01:40:31 <DrinkiePie>	I think I had like 7:1 on them winnign and having a defensive touchdown
Feb 02 01:40:37 <Conky>	I remember being in Toronto when there was a Toronto vs Ottawa game, the give and take between the fans in the bar was fucking hilarious, every time either team scored half the people for ottawa yell back at the toronto fans telling them how shit their team is, toronto didn't score so that kept happening.
Feb 02 01:42:27 <Conky>	Fucking maple leaves
Feb 02 01:42:34 <iocaineP>	leafs*

Feb 02 01:42:59 <Conky>	can't bring myself to do it
Feb 02 01:43:00 <iocaineP>	I knooow
Feb 02 01:43:09 <Coggler>	Do I want more tea, or water
Feb 02 01:43:12 <Trips>	put an egg in ur shoe and beat it

Feb 02 01:43:25 <Conky>	My friend used to say "Make like a tree and fuck off"
Feb 02 01:43:30 <Conky>	nice guy
Feb 02 01:43:35 <Trips>	I at least have work in the morning
Feb 02 01:43:43 <Trips>	but its an early release day
Feb 02 01:44:23 <Coggler>	I don't have a time I need to be up by tomorrow. I just need to make sure a lot of my school work is done by tomorrow night. I'm doing a lot of it tonight though. But I went with water because I haven't had much today.
Feb 02 01:44:29 <Conky>	I have to paint my grandmas house tomorrow morning, got home from work at 10pm "Oh yeah we need you to paint her house tomorrow, 10am" fucking 12 hours notice man
Feb 02 01:44:47 <Trips>	but thats what u do for grandma
Feb 02 01:45:02 <Trips>	also shit I need to find a place to leave
Feb 02 01:45:15 <Trips>	my parents are leaving wyoming and I'm staying
Feb 02 01:45:17 <Conky>	I like painting but these time slots are so arbitrary because nobody's at that house 
Feb 02 01:45:23 <Trips>	I'M GOING TO LIVE ALONE AGAIN YAAAYYYY
Feb 02 01:45:45 <Conky>	Painting is fine I don't care but I fucking hate getting short notice on things

Feb 02 01:49:11 <Trips>	nah my max is my best friendo
Feb 02 01:49:14 <Conky>	Like dogs that will eat you the second you die
Feb 02 01:49:23 <Trips>	but I'm going to get a kitten friend that will keep him company during the daytime and play with him
Feb 02 01:49:31 <Trips>	hopefully get him to lose some of his cat chub
Feb 02 01:49:49 <Conky>	50% chance the cat hates the kitten and hides from it
Feb 02 01:50:12 <kwulhu>	I like those odds
Feb 02 01:50:21 <Conky>	Never tell him the odds
Feb 02 01:50:34 <CaptChuckles>	I wonder how hard it is to get a a Seahawks XLIX champions shirt
Feb 02 01:51:05 <Conky>	XLIX Is that like extra large x9
Feb 02 01:51:08 <Trips>	don't they take all those kinda shirts and unload them onto like poor guatemalan kids or something
Feb 02 01:51:11 <Conky>	that's a big shirt
Feb 02 01:51:22 <kwulhu>	thought it was XLIV

Feb 03 20:46:14 <zoomin>	A week is practically ancient in internet times
Feb 03 20:46:22 <Conky>	Fucking 90's kids
Feb 03 20:46:23 <jeroknite>	Because the gat pellets have souls, Jeep
Feb 03 20:46:32 <jeroknite>	IF YOU CUT THEM, DO THEY NOT BLEED?
Feb 03 20:46:56 <jeep8790>	i mean i get that you need to diferentiate from the blanks but wouldnt it be easier to assume that blanks are marked as blanks and actual rooty tooty point and shooties are actual rooty tooty point and shooties
Feb 03 20:46:57 <Conky>	~8ball do they bleed?
Feb 03 20:46:58 <RariBot>	The answer to your query can be viewed by purchasing our eightball DLC! Now only $49.95! Purchase today!
Feb 03 20:47:15 <Conky>	always a catch

Feb 03 20:50:05 <zoomin>	its funny, when i first read that, i was vaping on some of my own homemade banana eliquid
Feb 03 20:50:07 <jeroknite>	Jeep, there was this one intentionally bad show that kept calling the bullets "gas powered rounds"
Feb 03 20:50:09 <zoomin>	good shit.
Feb 03 20:50:15 <jeep8790>	well
Feb 03 20:50:16 <Conky>	fucking vape culture got to zoomin

Feb 03 20:50:18 <jeep8790>	thats
Feb 03 20:50:25 <jeep8790>	i guess thats kinda correct
Feb 03 20:50:25 <jeroknite>	Technically accurate
Feb 03 20:50:29 <jeep8790>	yeah
Feb 03 20:50:31 <zoomin>	I've been vaping for almost six months, Conky 
Feb 03 20:50:39 <Conky>	you have heelies?
Feb 03 20:50:46 <zoomin>	Only smoked one stinky since then
Feb 03 20:50:49 <Conky>	beanie hat even though you live in california?
Feb 03 20:50:53 <zoomin>	no, but i do still have a pair of soaps
Feb 03 20:50:58 <zoomin>	If you remember soaps.
Feb 03 20:51:06 <zoomin>	they were made by heelies
Feb 03 20:51:10 <Conky>	Do you ride around town on a ripstick
Feb 03 20:51:18 <zoomin>	I wish i still had a ripstick
Feb 03 20:51:19 <jeroknite>	Of course I remember soap, I still bathe
Feb 03 20:51:24 <zoomin>	heh.
Feb 03 20:51:31 <Conky>	~ud soap
Feb 03 20:51:32 <RariBot>	Something you better not drop in jail!
Feb 03 20:51:35 <zoomin>	I used to have a ripstick, it was a lot of fun
Feb 03 20:51:45 <zoomin>	I do longboard, though
Feb 03 20:51:49 <jeroknite>	I'll rip your stick
Feb 03 20:51:53 <Conky>	~rande621 rip_stick
Feb 03 20:51:55 <RariBot>	No Results
Feb 03 20:52:10 <zoomin>	and i still have two skateboards
Feb 03 20:52:17 <zoomin>	But i dont really skate or anything anymore
Feb 03 20:52:17 <jeep8790>	is this movie how the rest of the world views americans
Feb 03 20:52:20 <Conky>	skateboards are neat
Feb 03 20:52:27 <zoomin>	I used to be super into it
Feb 03 20:52:30 <zoomin>	Was pretty good, too
Feb 03 20:52:32 <Conky>	You mean the fatties Jeep?
Feb 03 20:52:32 <jeroknite>	Everybody hates Americans, Jeep
Feb 03 20:52:38 <Conky>	because pretty much
Feb 03 20:52:46 <jeep8790>	and the guy at the resteraunt
Feb 03 20:52:52 <jeep8790>	and the midget dwarf
Feb 03 20:53:06 <jeroknite>	You only need to say one of those words

Feb 03 20:53:15 <zoomin>	Conky,

Feb 03 20:53:18 <zoomin>	You ever see these?
Feb 03 20:53:25 <zoomin>	they were shoes with grind plates on the bottom
Feb 03 20:53:25 <jeroknite>	o
Feb 03 20:53:31 <zoomin>	could ride them down rails and shit
Feb 03 20:53:33 <zoomin>	they were a lot of fun
Feb 03 20:53:36 <Conky>	oh yeah
Feb 03 20:53:54 <zoomin>	i got in trouble in middle school like every day cuz when school got out i would grind down the railing to the bus zone
Feb 03 20:53:55 <Conky>	except the only grinding I ever did was on rails snowboarding
Feb 03 20:53:59 <zoomin>	It was a lot of fun
Feb 03 20:54:04 <jeroknite>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_%28shoes%29#Soap_shoes_in_Sonic_the_Hedgehog
Feb 03 20:54:04 <jeep8790>	"wow you two are wierd....would you two like some cocaine?"
Feb 03 20:54:20 <Conky>	it's only polite to offer
Feb 03 20:54:31 <zoomin>	I'm going to colarado to snowboard when my friends are on spring break
Feb 03 20:54:36 <zoomin>	Pretty hyped for that,
Feb 03 20:55:14 <jeep8790>	this movie has
Feb 03 20:55:15 <jeep8790>	like
Feb 03 20:55:18 <zoomin>	oh yeah
Feb 03 20:55:22 <jeep8790>	the atmosphere of some 
Feb 03 20:55:24 <jeep8790>	like
Feb 03 20:55:26 <jeep8790>	not artsy
Feb 03 20:55:28 <jeroknite>	like
Feb 03 20:55:33 <zoomin>	sonic the hedgehog wore soaps in sonic adventure 2
Feb 03 20:55:37 <jeep8790>	i dont know i wouldnt call it serious either
Feb 03 20:55:47 <zoomin>	So did shadow.
Feb 03 20:55:51 <jeep8790>	but its a bit 
Feb 03 20:56:01 <jeroknite>	Pretentious?
Feb 03 20:56:01 <jeep8790>	sorta not strange mixed with the comedy of it
Feb 03 20:56:05 <jeep8790>	no
Feb 03 20:56:59 <AttackTheMoon>	hur bur

Feb 03 21:06:29 <AttackTheMoon>	i thought it was pretty bad tbh
Feb 03 21:06:36 <J-Brony>	and when he came to RT I was excited.  I liked the first season of RWBY
Feb 03 21:06:58 <AttackTheMoon>	never watched  RWBY
Feb 03 21:07:05 <jeroknite>	I'm only aware of him because he died

Feb 03 21:07:32 <AttackTheMoon>	it is
Feb 03 21:07:34 <J-Brony>	Looking back on it, it looks dated and kind of stilted. But when he made that and the fact he made it by himself was pretty impresive.

Feb 03 21:07:51 <RainbowPonySemen>	it is pretty old

Feb 03 22:48:18 <Conky>	time to start a business called "brotherhood of feels"
Feb 03 22:48:51 <Conky>	It'll just be a big lan party going all the time, and with a buffet
Feb 03 22:48:56 <Conky>	plus open bar
Feb 03 22:49:22 <Conky>	And membership only requires you to know that feel when

Feb 03 22:49:44 <Conky>	what do you do?
Feb 03 22:49:57 <J-Brony>	System admin
Feb 03 22:50:57 <Conky>	sounds boring
Feb 03 22:51:50 <Conky>	do you have strong enough connection with the company to stay in it? you could always ask for some kind of transfer within the same company if you didn't want to leave it and all the built up time there
Feb 03 22:52:32 <J-Brony>	I am looking for a new place been there 10 years.
Feb 03 22:52:40 <Conky>	Or you could always quit your job and work on an oil rig in the atlantic

Feb 03 22:54:46 <J-Brony>	Well its not 10 years of the same thing.  But yeah
Feb 03 22:54:55 <Conky>	But some places will call that "over qualified"
Feb 03 22:54:59 <Conky>	Whatever that means ;-;
Feb 03 22:55:20 <Trips>	that means "we aren't willing to pay the applicant what they deserve"
Feb 03 22:55:36 <Conky>	then pay me less just gimme a job plz

Feb 03 22:58:27 <Trips>	movie is metal as hell

Feb 03 22:59:09 <Trips>	one of the best sub movies which is actually realistic
Feb 03 22:59:10 <Princess_Pwny>	I've been using that for a while now
Feb 03 22:59:32 <AttackTheMoon>	Princess_Pwny, is it good?
Feb 03 22:59:35 <AttackTheMoon>	J-Brony, i use the one that has a hand
Feb 03 22:59:38 <AttackTheMoon>	idk what its called
Feb 03 22:59:49 <Princess_Pwny>	Yeah, it seems pretty good, had no issues at all with it so far
Feb 03 22:59:49 <Trips>	I use AB+ ;-;
Feb 03 22:59:53 <Princess_Pwny>	Lets you select lots of lists
Feb 03 23:00:09 <Trips>	but I agree, whitelist on an adblocker is garbage
Feb 03 23:00:19 <Trips>	I don't want to see ANY. ADS. AT. ALL
Feb 03 23:01:12 <AttackTheMoon>	https://getadblock.com/ 
Feb 03 23:01:13 <Princess_Pwny>	I'll point out that addblock has been letting ads through for a long time now
Feb 03 23:01:14 <AttackTheMoon>	i use this one
Feb 03 23:01:22 <AttackTheMoon>	idk which one it is lel
Feb 03 23:01:26 <AttackTheMoon>	its just addblock
Feb 03 23:01:32 <Princess_Pwny>	And there is a tickbox to dissalow acceptable ads
Feb 03 23:01:44 <AttackTheMoon>	>tfw noone posts on the #rr&gfd irc
Feb 03 23:01:53 <Princess_Pwny>	Which is what the ads they are getting paid for appear under
Feb 03 23:02:10 <J-Brony>	Fair enough.
Feb 03 23:02:13 <Princess_Pwny>	AFAIK as long as you change the default setting on that tickbox you are fine
Feb 03 23:02:17 <AttackTheMoon>	^
Feb 03 23:02:43 <AttackTheMoon>	https://41.media.tumblr.com/78d8e428b0629d3563ab7f98df5e4f3f/tumblr_nj89ed42N81rql4qwo1_500.jpg
Feb 03 23:04:46 <J-Brony>	I also wonder about the advertising industry on the web.  I have never knowingly clicked on an ad.  Thats not to say an ad has not influenced me to research deeper. But if they pay on the click I am doing nothing for the sites I visit blocker or not.
Feb 03 23:05:13 <Princess_Pwny>	Some ads are per-impression and some are per click and some are both
Feb 03 23:05:27 <Princess_Pwny>	Just seeing the ad is enough for some of them to get some sort of small paymenty
Feb 03 23:06:06 <J-Brony>	True, but I have to think the per click are the more lucrative that sites would prefer.  (Guessing no stats to back it up)
Feb 03 23:06:42 <Princess_Pwny>	I do believe per-click is better in terms ofi how much money it's worth
Feb 03 23:07:20 <J-Brony>	And some sites (such as ars that I posted before) offer subscriptions to get money in other ways without adds. Then there are folks like hulu that have you pay money for some things but still show ads anyways.
Feb 03 23:07:31 <AttackTheMoon>	hulu is fucking awful
Feb 03 23:07:35 <AttackTheMoon>	i refuse to use it
Feb 03 23:10:40 <J-Brony>	I think I've been useing some form of ad block since at least the early 2000's.  The rare ocasion I have of using a non ad blocked terminal it is startling how far the add agency's have not progressed.
Feb 03 23:10:50 <J-Brony>	Its still the same ads from 2001 
Feb 03 23:11:48 <AttackTheMoon>	adds are the worst
Feb 03 23:13:07 <J-Brony>	Sorry, I know I keep adding the extra d. 
Feb 03 23:13:13 <AttackTheMoon>	no sorry
Feb 03 23:13:15 <AttackTheMoon>	its me
Feb 03 23:13:17 <AttackTheMoon>	i didnt notice
Feb 03 23:13:17 <J-Brony>	I am a silly drunk man
Feb 03 23:14:04 <J-Brony>	But the fact that I STILL see ads like this on the web: http://media.theonion.com/images/articles/article/5820/Dancing-Mortgage_jpg_250x1000_q85.jpg
Feb 03 23:14:13 <J-Brony>	Advertising pls
Feb 03 23:14:15 <AttackTheMoon>	ya
Feb 03 23:15:14 <DrinkiePie>	I felt like those should be less common after 2008
Feb 03 23:15:17 <J-Brony>	The subtle irony that its a picture on the onion is not lost to me. 
Feb 03 23:15:17 <DrinkiePie>	but what do I know
Feb 03 23:16:00 <J-Brony>	They are probably less common.  But the fact that they exist at all is amazing IMO.
Feb 03 23:25:30 <Trips>	people are still stupid enough to keep clicking on them so why not
Feb 03 23:25:47 <RisenLM>	That's a big mortgage, but then again houses don't cost as much around here
Feb 03 23:25:56 <J-Brony>	So I am looking back at some of the stuff in the Ulbricht trial and it is humorous to me now how fucked he was from day 3 of the trial. 
Feb 03 23:26:11 <J-Brony>	Some may say day 1
Feb 03 23:26:15 <RisenLM>	Trips you aren't on other methods of communication
Feb 03 23:26:26 <Trips>	?

Feb 04 02:54:50 <Seal>	;)
Feb 04 02:55:05 <Seal>	also at least in a tank you're either fine or you die instantly
Feb 04 02:55:17 <Seal>	instead of waiting to suffocate or being crushed
Feb 04 02:57:31 <Trips>	never mind all the other shit that can conceivably go wrong
Feb 04 02:57:48 <Trips>	like if the battery catches fire and releases toxic gas into the engine room or something
Feb 04 02:58:37 <Conky>	Or if you get diabetes and have no insulin because you're on a submarine
Feb 04 02:59:00 <Conky>	or what if there's an earthquake
Feb 04 02:59:23 <Seal>	I mean
Feb 04 02:59:30 <Seal>	you'd probably be fine if there was an earthquake
Feb 04 02:59:32 <Trips>	if there is an earthquake you will be fine
Feb 04 02:59:50 <Conky>	What if you fall into the newly formed fault
Feb 04 02:59:54 <Seal>	it
Feb 04 03:00:01 <Seal>	they don't have those
Feb 04 03:00:03 <Seal>	in europe
Feb 04 03:00:06 <Seal>	those are only in like
Feb 04 03:00:07 <Seal>	the US
Feb 04 03:00:18 <Trips>	ok seal
Feb 04 03:00:42 <Seal>	I mean
Feb 04 03:00:55 <Seal>	they have them as in there are tectonic plates that slide around
Feb 04 03:01:04 <Seal>	but I'm pretty sure the opening up kind are only in the americas
Feb 04 03:02:36 <Seal>	anyways
Feb 04 03:02:45 <Seal>	Conky: the water would go in the fault first
Feb 04 03:02:57 <Seal>	and even if you got sucked in too you could get back out
Feb 04 03:04:15 <Conky>	yeah but what if a giant squid latches on to you so you have too much weight and can't resurface
Feb 04 03:05:33 <Trips>	send divers out the torpedo tubes with harpoons
Feb 04 03:05:38 <Trips>	calimari's back on the menu boys
Feb 04 03:06:28 <Conky>	What if there's a pinhole leak and you don't have an earring to plug it
Feb 04 03:06:59 <Trips>	rip
Feb 04 03:10:37 *	Conky sends for help
Feb 04 03:10:39 <kwulhu>	ded
Feb 04 03:10:50 <Conky>	Man that humble bundle with star wars games is fucking great though
Feb 04 03:11:19 <Conky>	I've played all of those games before and loved most of them now I own them all for 12 dollars worth it
Feb 04 03:12:57 <Seal>	Conky: I'd imagine that giant squids are neutrally buoyant
Feb 04 03:13:04 <Seal>	and
Feb 04 03:13:18 <Seal>	pinhole leaks that can be plugged with an earring are probably not that big of a deal
Feb 04 03:13:18 <Conky>	yeah but this one ate a lot of fast food
Feb 04 03:13:36 <Seal>	o
Feb 04 03:18:21 <Trips>	fast food more like fat food
Feb 04 03:18:32 <Conky>	good one

Feb 04 09:46:18 <Esplin>	what
Feb 04 09:46:21 <jeroknite>	I had one of those aligator toys

Feb 04 09:46:38 <jeroknite>	Oh
Feb 04 09:46:41 <jeroknite>	Well
Feb 04 09:46:58 <Esplin>	It started to be packed in with childhoodpack91.exe
Feb 04 09:47:23 <jeroknite>	Did you see how the person on the left started to press a tooth, and then switched to another one?
Feb 04 09:47:42 <Esplin>	did you look at the top of the mouth?
Feb 04 09:47:46 <jeroknite>	Yes
Feb 04 09:47:49 <jeroknite>	I saw the knives
Feb 04 09:48:09 <jeroknite>	But that person was cheating
Feb 04 09:48:23 <Esplin>	LIES
Feb 04 09:48:36 <jeroknite>	The teeth that trigger the mouth to close are slightly harder to press down
Feb 04 09:48:54 <Esplin>	Well I never knew that

Feb 04 16:14:44 <Conky>	that's just default
Feb 04 16:15:20 <Conky>	Pretty sure the only reason for it is supposed to be ease of access to saved files
Feb 04 16:15:27 <Conky>	doesn't really matter where they are

Feb 04 17:05:43 <jeep8790>	in trying to do something stupid they actually did the right thing
Feb 04 17:08:21 <bitchcakes>	so does the first amendment not apply anymore
Feb 04 17:08:31 <jeep8790>	well 
Feb 04 17:08:43 <DrinkiePie>	no
Feb 04 17:09:16 <jeep8790>	taking nude pics of yourself and sending them to someone is technically creation and distribution of child pornography
Feb 04 17:09:22 <jeep8790>	if you're underage
Feb 04 17:09:27 <jeep8790>	so
Feb 04 17:09:43 <bitchcakes>	o
Feb 04 17:09:49 <bitchcakes>	see my version of sexting is just like
Feb 04 17:09:51 <bitchcakes>	dirty talk lol
Feb 04 17:09:54 <jeep8790>	at the very least that law would have been a lot fucking better than getting them on the sex offender list for
Feb 04 17:09:54 <jeep8790>	well
Feb 04 17:09:58 <jeep8790>	no reason at all
Feb 04 17:10:11 <DrinkiePie>	I think the law was against image sending
Feb 04 17:10:15 <DrinkiePie>	I think dirty talk is still elga
Feb 04 17:13:02 <bitchcakes>	the first comment hits the nail on the head
Feb 04 17:13:35 <DrinkiePie>	the only issue with that logic is that teenagers don't care about nominally illegal things
Feb 04 17:13:42 <DrinkiePie>	there should be a slap on the wrist and maybe like four hours of community service
Feb 04 17:13:49 <DrinkiePie>	without it being recorded / you being a sex offender
Feb 04 17:14:26 <jeep8790>	for willingly sending nudie pics of yourself to someone cause you're a retard?
Feb 04 17:14:34 <bitchcakes>	shrug
Feb 04 17:14:36 <jeep8790>	the law shouldnt even be involved in any way

Feb 04 18:41:21 *	Esplin gies jeep the channel papoose and goes to find dinner
Feb 04 18:41:22 <Trips>	just for fuckin laughs
Feb 04 18:41:33 <Trips>	but then I actually tried playing 40k and I fucking hated it
Feb 04 18:41:37 <jeep8790>	http://i.imgur.com/FFPwjQ2.jpg
Feb 04 18:41:46 <jeep8790>	thats why
Feb 04 18:41:54 <jeep8790>	you just get into the lore
Feb 04 18:41:55 <Conky>	I wanted to get into 40k when I was a kid buy that price tag
Feb 04 18:42:09 <Esplin>	the lore is shit nothing good ever happens
Feb 04 18:42:18 <jeep8790>	so?
Feb 04 18:42:23 <jeep8790>	and the books
Feb 04 18:42:24 <Conky>	So I just bought thousands of magic cards
Feb 04 18:42:30 <Trips>	I think the lore is interesting, the gameplay suuucccckkks so bad
Feb 04 18:42:42 <Trips>	also I've read a couple really outstanding books
Feb 04 18:42:53 <Conky>	If I want to read about the lore I'll read a book 
Feb 04 18:42:59 <Trips>	it would be much better as a computer game than a tabletop game
Feb 04 18:43:10 <jeep8790>	honetly
Feb 04 18:43:10 <Seal>	Conky: why would you buy thousands of magic cards
Feb 04 18:43:12 <jeep8790>	if you want lore
Feb 04 18:43:16 <jeep8790>	wikias
Feb 04 18:43:16 <Conky>	Hah you'd think so but the 40k games for pc have mostly been shit
Feb 04 18:43:18 <Seal>	instead of just playing the computer version and having all the cards
Feb 04 18:43:21 <jeep8790>	fucking wikias
Feb 04 18:43:27 <Conky>	Lol Seal that's lame
Feb 04 18:43:30 <jeep8790>	and 1d4chan for humor
Feb 04 18:43:31 <Seal>	ur lame
Feb 04 18:43:32 <Trips>	it's cause none of them have been made faithfully to the tabletop rules
Feb 04 18:43:35 <Trips>	which seems like a no-brainer
Feb 04 18:43:37 <Conky>	Everyone loves opening packs of cards
Feb 04 18:43:38 <Esplin>	STOP ASKING ME  TO SELECT IMAGES OF STEAKS 4CHAN CAPTCHA

Feb 04 18:44:37 <Conky>	Plus when you buy your own cards and build your own deck, it's YOURS, not the same when you own a copy of the licensing agreement allowing you to own the cards in game 
Feb 04 18:44:38 <bitchcakes>	custom design
Feb 04 18:44:40 <Seal>	uh
Feb 04 18:44:44 <Seal>	oh meme

Feb 04 18:46:32 <Conky>	~ud genderqueer
Feb 04 18:46:33 <RariBot>	Genderqueer is most commonly used to describe a person who feels that his/her gender identity does not fit into the socially constructed "norms" associated with his/her biological sex. Genderqueer is an identity that falls anywhere between man/boy/male and woman/girl/female on the spectrum of gender identities.
Feb 04 18:46:34 <Seal>	that'd work better if it was your drivers license background
Feb 04 18:46:34 <Trips>	what is genderqueer is that like "undecided"
Feb 04 18:46:44 <bitchcakes>	is like a mix
Feb 04 18:46:46 <Seal>	Trips: genderqueer is not male nor female
Feb 04 18:46:49 <Seal>	gender
Feb 04 18:46:50 <Seal>	not sex
Feb 04 18:46:53 <Esplin>	http://s1.webmshare.com/gQrrv.webm
Feb 04 18:46:57 <Seal>	neither male nor female sex is intersex
Feb 04 18:47:01 <Conky>	So what is it
Feb 04 18:47:12 <Seal>	Conky: the gender one

Feb 04 18:48:38 *	Trips sends bitchcakes 600 emails
Feb 04 18:48:39 <Seal>	but it's just a debit card
Feb 04 18:48:43 <bitchcakes>	(â‰§Ï‰â‰¦)
Feb 04 18:49:11 <bitchcakes>	should i just make my card one big one?

Feb 04 18:49:24 <Conky>	pattern is cheesy

Feb 05 00:34:02 <RisenLM>	I've played SMB with a keyboard, and I always felt like me dying was just my own ineptitude rather than the control scheme

Feb 05 18:19:43 <c_h_i_c_k_e_n_s>	its pretty wierd in general that you find all your ammo on the ground in fps games
Feb 05 18:19:51 <jeep8790>	why
Feb 05 18:20:08 <c_h_i_c_k_e_n_s>	because in most of them it doesn't make sense that the ammo would be where it is
Feb 05 18:20:23 <jeep8790>	i think it makes perfect sense that bullets would be in guns
Feb 05 18:20:30 <jeep8790>	but thats just me

Feb 05 18:23:32 <jeep8790>	well yeah it wouldnt make any sense for the ammo to be in stashes
Feb 05 18:23:36 <jeep8790>	that would be crazy
Feb 05 18:23:49 <jeep8790>	even though thats the case for both games
Feb 05 18:24:33 <Trips>	xen is the worst example in half life
Feb 05 18:24:50 <Trips>	just random boxes full of rockets, grenades, revolver rounds, assault rifle magazines..
