Aug 22 15:25:12 <Herabek>	if patton dedicated as much time to starcraft as real war
Aug 22 15:25:14 <derram>	that makes more sense

Aug 22 15:25:35 <Socialery>	!!bpm
Aug 22 15:25:41 <derram>	because two corpses hung over a keyboard wouldn't do much

Aug 22 15:26:24 <kwulhu>	in Starcraft there's no such thing as morale, and you train units as the battle is going on
Aug 22 15:26:25 <Herabek>	what social?

Aug 22 16:16:38 <S>	<Twi`Naga> NO
Aug 22 16:16:40 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> I can't believe him
Aug 22 16:16:42 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I'VE GOT A BETTER ONE
Aug 22 16:16:43 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> he linked me to this
Aug 22 16:16:54 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> yeah but the problem with the individual videos
Aug 22 16:17:02 <S>	<Herabek> I remember when LIttle Kuribo was pretty much the only one doing an abridged series.
Aug 22 16:17:05 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> is that the HD quality doesn't always stay consistant
Aug 22 16:17:05 <S>	<Herabek> and it was good.
Aug 22 16:17:14 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> which is annoying
Aug 22 16:17:15 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> to me
Aug 22 16:17:28 <S>	<Twi`Naga> http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEF5134278F1E90C0&feature=plcp
Aug 22 16:17:29 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> though on the plus side
Aug 22 16:17:40 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> the individual ones make it easy to skip around in
Aug 22 16:17:49 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> where as yt skipping on long ass videos
Aug 22 16:17:52 <S>	<Twi`Naga> My own play list.  All of the eps from the original uploaders.  All jokes intact. http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEF5134278F1E90C0&feature=plcp
Aug 22 16:17:54 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> likes to derp big time

Aug 22 16:18:13 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> and by skipping I mean seeking
Aug 22 16:18:25 <S>	<Herabek> anybody know the theoretical limit for RJ-11 cable?
Aug 22 16:18:27 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> oh yeah
Aug 22 16:18:27 <S>	<Herabek> distance
Aug 22 16:18:39 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> does anyone use Chrome and Derpy Orange Reds?
Aug 22 16:18:42 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> *orangereds
Aug 22 16:18:45 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> cause that updated
Aug 22 16:18:48 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> silently
Aug 22 16:18:52 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I use firefox and everything.
Aug 22 16:18:57 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> I love Firefox
Aug 22 16:19:00 <derram>	^
Aug 22 16:19:03 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> used to develop on that
Aug 22 16:19:08 <S>	<Herabek> Chrome but no derpy.
Aug 22 16:19:14 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> you should get it
Aug 22 16:19:18 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> great little script imo
Aug 22 16:19:20 <S>	<Herabek> Why?
Aug 22 16:19:30 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> It checks for orangereds for you
Aug 22 16:19:36 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> and alerts you to new ones
Aug 22 16:19:39 <S>	<Herabek> I have a thing that does that already...
Aug 22 16:19:42 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Because it has derpy going I BROUGHT YOU A LETTER!
Aug 22 16:19:49 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> or scootaloo doing it too
Aug 22 16:19:49 <S>	<Herabek> That sounds hella annoying.
Aug 22 16:19:54 *	Meatloaf has quit (Ping timeout)
Aug 22 16:19:57 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> you don't have to have it use a sound
Aug 22 16:20:13 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> sound is optional
Aug 22 16:20:20 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> derpy just replaces your mail icons
Aug 22 16:20:24 *	Meatloaf1 has quit (Connection reset by peer)
Aug 22 16:20:25 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> (or doesn't, your choice)
Aug 22 16:20:39 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> and she checks for mail and lets you know about new mail messages
Aug 22 16:20:44 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> it's pretty handy imo
Aug 22 16:20:49 <derram>	^
Aug 22 16:20:54 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> then again
Aug 22 16:20:55 <S>	<Herabek> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/algjnflpgoopkdijmkalfcifomdhmcbe
Aug 22 16:20:56 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> I'm biased
Aug 22 16:21:07 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> Ah yes
Aug 22 16:21:16 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> I didn't like the bar though
Aug 22 16:21:23 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> idk if you can tunr that off
Aug 22 16:21:27 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> *turn
Aug 22 16:21:36 <S>	<Herabek> I like it because it lets you upvote after viewing a submission, and if it's in the way just hit the x
Aug 22 16:21:43 <S>	<Herabek> it also gives you a convenient link to the comments
Aug 22 16:21:51 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> yeah but I never liked the bar in the first place
Aug 22 16:21:52 <S>	<Herabek> or a favorite button!
Aug 22 16:22:00 <S>	<Herabek> I read that, yes.
Aug 22 16:22:02 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> but I understand that
Aug 22 16:22:06 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> if you like it
Aug 22 16:22:25 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> honestly to have desktop notifications, I'd have to wrap derpy into a chrome extension
Aug 22 16:22:37 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> which is acutally more of a bitch if you think about it
Aug 22 16:22:38 <S>	<Herabek> http://i.imgur.com/2yhsb.png
Aug 22 16:22:49 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> because each of my scripts are dynamically generated for the user
Aug 22 16:22:57 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> because otherwise
Aug 22 16:22:59 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> why would you want
Aug 22 16:23:10 <S>	<Herabek> The nice thing about it
Aug 22 16:23:10 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> a 1MB script if you aren't going to use sounds?

Aug 22 16:24:36 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> a well designed chrome extension?
Aug 22 16:24:37 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> no
Aug 22 16:24:40 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> it can't be

Aug 22 16:25:04 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> of this
Aug 22 16:25:30 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> oh it's a button
Aug 22 16:25:32 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> well that's dumb
Aug 22 16:25:41 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> I thought it replaced the awesomebar/omnibox
Aug 22 16:25:45 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> fuck those are terrible names
Aug 22 16:26:27 <S>	<Herabek> what?
Aug 22 16:26:44 <Iocaine>	^
Aug 22 16:26:51 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> Firefox calls it's url bar the awesomebar
Aug 22 16:26:56 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> Chrome calls it the omnibox
Aug 22 16:26:59 <S>	<RainbowDashJedi-22in3days> both are terrible names
Aug 22 16:27:00 <Iocaine>	oh god
Aug 22 16:27:13 <Iocaine>	why have a name at all
Aug 22 16:27:13 <kwulhu>	[](/b05)
Aug 22 16:27:49 <S>	<Herabek> Omnibox makes more sense than awesomebar, because it combines quicksearch and URL bar into one.
Aug 22 16:27:57 <S>	<Herabek> still a dorktastic name.
Aug 22 16:28:05 <Iocaine>	yup.

Aug 22 16:58:33 <Herabek>	and I at 25 inches I wouldn't get that much out of higher res for games, but I would take a performance hit.

Aug 22 17:48:34 <S>	<Herabek> I've got a bunch of audio fucking with software
Aug 22 17:48:38 <S>	<Herabek> I could probably do it.

Aug 22 17:52:03 <S>	ACTION PrincessMolestia sighs
Aug 22 17:52:03 <Herabek>	I should take it into qubase and put some drumkits behind things 
Aug 22 17:52:04 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> Welp
Aug 22 17:52:10 <Herabek>	just because 
Aug 22 17:52:14 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> I'm stuck on the next part after the mainframe.
Aug 22 17:52:20 <S>	<Adagio> I am so bad with doing drums
Aug 22 17:52:27 <Herabek>	ORLY?
Aug 22 17:52:33 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> Yarly
Aug 22 17:52:35 <S>	<Adagio> the only thing Ive put drums in other than that was the daft punk cover thing
Aug 22 17:52:43 <S>	<Adagio> And that sounds like shit
Aug 22 17:53:07 <Herabek>	So, here's a question
Aug 22 17:53:46 <Herabek>	do you think people generally like to hear the sound of sliding from one chord to another (not sure what the name is) or do people prefer to not hear that?
Aug 22 17:53:56 <Herabek>	I like it, myself, I guess it makes it feel more authentic somehow
Aug 22 17:54:09 <Herabek>	But I don't really know what's considered good in that regard.
Aug 22 17:54:22 <Herabek>	Don't know shit about playing guitars.
Aug 22 17:54:29 <S>	<Adagio> If I left it in, it's because I liked how it sounded
Aug 22 17:54:33 *	Meatloaf has quit (Connection reset by peer)
Aug 22 17:54:57 <S>	<Adagio> Normally I try to avoid that sound, but it worked for that one
Aug 22 17:55:19 <S>	<Adagio> If I were to change anything though, it'd be those awkward pauses in there
Aug 22 17:55:25 <Herabek>	Hmm.
Aug 22 17:55:34 <S>	<Adagio> Like at :08
Aug 22 17:56:03 <Herabek>	Didn't strike me as awkward, but I can hear it, yeah
Aug 22 17:56:11 <Herabek>	I actually have a classical guitar
Aug 22 17:56:15 <Herabek>	and no idea now to play it...
Aug 22 17:56:30 <S>	<Adagio> I want one of those
Aug 22 17:56:44 <S>	<Adagio> I don't have a nylon string
Aug 22 17:57:12 <Herabek>	Let's say I suddenly got inspired to learn
Aug 22 17:57:17 <Herabek>	any resources you suggest?
Aug 22 17:58:26 <S>	<Adagio> A good teacher. If you want to learn basic chords/scales then I could probably help a bit, but what you really want is some 1on1 instruction

Aug 22 18:04:19 <S>	Books left chat
Aug 22 18:04:21 <S>	<Adagio> Because I can actually play decently with one hand

Aug 22 18:04:29 <Herabek>	Huh
Aug 22 18:04:29 <S>	<Adagio> it all goes out the window
Aug 22 18:04:43 <Herabek>	I guess I started so young that it never seemed hard to me.
Aug 22 18:04:59 <Herabek>	For me the challenge is when you start jumping allover the place trying to land on the right note
Aug 22 18:05:28 <Herabek>	Also chord accompaniment on the fly is challenging, but fun.

Aug 22 18:13:58 <Herabek>	Well, maybe I'll look into finding a guitar teacher.
Aug 22 18:14:49 <S>	<Adagio> If you want to use Skype, I can teach you some basic shit. I've given hiero and Jajent some lessons, not sure how helpful they were, but /b03
Aug 22 18:15:07 <S>	<Adagio> It'll have to be later though, because I need to ferry my siblings around in a sec
Aug 22 18:16:47 <Herabek>	I might take you up on that in a couple weeks, I'll be scouring youtube for lessons about proper hand positioning, strumming, etc
Aug 22 18:16:53 <Herabek>	so I don't start building bad habbits
Aug 22 18:17:03 <S>	<Adagio> >youtube lessons
Aug 22 18:17:19 <Herabek>	I have some books and stuff
Aug 22 18:17:24 <Herabek>	but video helps as a reference
Aug 22 18:17:34 <Herabek>	obviously it can't look at what I'm doing and correct me
Aug 22 18:17:45 <Herabek>	I'm pretty good about being critical of myself though.
Aug 22 18:17:49 <S>	<Adagio> That's why skype
Aug 22 18:17:59 <S>	<Adagio> But good rule for your left hand
Aug 22 18:18:04 <Herabek>	Mm hmm?
Aug 22 18:18:29 <S>	<Adagio> Keep a gap, don't just slot the neck into the space between your index and thumb
Aug 22 18:18:35 <S>	<Adagio> It'll make it hard to move around
Aug 22 18:19:04 <Herabek>	So
Aug 22 18:19:09 <Herabek>	what if I play like I snowboard

Aug 22 18:19:26 <Herabek>	yeah
Aug 22 18:19:28 <Herabek>	I'm not
Aug 22 18:19:33 <S>	<Adagio> Same as what I just said, but for your right hand
Aug 22 18:19:57 <Herabek>	I actually find it easier to do somethings with my left than my right, some how.
Aug 22 18:20:00 <S>	<Adagio> Basically, you want a gap between the neck and that part where your thumb and index connect
Aug 22 18:20:10 <Herabek>	Gotcha.

Aug 22 21:54:11 <Soci|Uni>	but yeah, the first and only function was added yesterday, feels really bad programming
Aug 22 21:54:30 <Soci|Uni>	and the function constantly raises errors
Aug 22 21:54:48 <GabeBearington>	Soci|Uni / cheesemoo ... feels so good doing anything in C because it feels so solid. It doesn't matter if it takes longer to write and doesn't have so many elegant tricks because it's C and that's how it's supposed to be.
Aug 22 21:55:07 *	Soci|Uni nods
Aug 22 21:55:21 <cheesemoo>	blerh
Aug 22 21:55:30 <GabeBearington>	And the dynamic loading is elegant enough for me :D

Aug 22 23:31:55 <GabeBearington>	Pinkies eyes, as well as rarity and twilight's, are wrong. Rarity's eyes are supposed to be gray flecked, twilight's should be red, and pinkie shouldn't have had any eyes to begin with so talking about the colour is a moot point.

Aug 23 12:07:14 <wolfieshy>	I love connecting the meanings of words I already knew with each other in ways I didn't notice before
Aug 23 12:07:29 <wolfieshy>	like when I noticed alterego literally means other self a while ago
Aug 23 12:07:36 <wolfieshy>	alter ego
Aug 23 12:09:36 <S>	<Twi`Naga> So
Aug 23 12:09:38 <S>	<Twi`Naga> you mean like
Aug 23 12:09:40 <S>	<Twi`Naga> the word faggot
Aug 23 12:09:46 <S>	<Twi`Naga> and connecting it with you?
Aug 23 12:10:22 <Esplin>	fagball
Aug 23 12:10:33 <wolfieshy>	right
Aug 23 12:10:50 <S>	<Twi`Naga> It's where you kick around a faggot, and try to get him into the goal.
Aug 23 12:10:58 <wolfieshy>	and connecting you to http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Twi%27lek
Aug 23 12:11:01 <S>	<Twi`Naga> You get bonus points if your shoe gets stuck in his anus.
Aug 23 12:12:33 <S>	<Twi`Naga> See, I don't care, because I know that you know what it is.  You're not legitimately making the wrong reference out of ignorance.
Aug 23 12:12:51 <S>	<Twi`Naga> You're doing it out of stupidity.

Aug 23 12:59:50 <S>	<Twi`Naga> you know what?
Aug 23 12:59:56 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Now that we've got a new emote script
Aug 23 13:00:02 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I bet I can run RES without hte slowdown
Aug 23 13:00:13 <S>	<Twi`Naga> because I took it off AGES ago, thinking that's what caused it.
Aug 23 13:00:20 <S>	EbolaBandit left chat
Aug 23 13:00:36 <derram>	maybe 
Aug 23 13:00:42 <derram>	RES does a lot of stuff
Aug 23 13:00:52 <derram>	and it does it to every comment on a page
Aug 23 13:00:58 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Ah.
Aug 23 13:01:02 <S>	<Twi`Naga> So, maybe not.
Aug 23 13:01:08 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Still, doesn't hurt to try
Aug 23 13:01:20 <derram>	MAP only started adding slowdown after 200 comments or so
Aug 23 13:01:27 <derram>	at least for me
Aug 23 13:01:37 <derram>	That's why I never really noticed it 
Aug 23 13:01:43 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I think I'll just comment somewhere with "Reddit Enhancement Suite" and have someone link it.
Aug 23 13:01:51 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Naw, my reddit was incredibly slow ALL THE TIME
Aug 23 13:01:55 <S>	<Twi`Naga> no matter what page I used.

Aug 23 13:02:26 <derram>	technically still did it
Aug 23 13:02:42 <The_Catman>	you commented
Aug 23 13:02:48 <The_Catman>	Q gave you a link
Aug 23 13:03:04 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Yeah, but it wasn't some random guy checking metareddit.
Aug 23 13:04:00 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Oh yeah.  I've still got it installed.

Aug 23 13:05:03 <S>	<Twi`Naga> okay
Aug 23 13:05:12 <derram>	'cause Ref is just as much of an ass as Hom3r

Aug 23 13:06:02 <derram>	Refryan
Aug 23 13:06:11 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Ah.
Aug 23 13:06:48 <S>	<Twi`Naga> How is Refrayn an ass again?
Aug 23 13:06:54 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Because the name is sorta pompous?
Aug 23 13:07:10 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Because it kinda is.
Aug 23 13:07:11 <derram>	sorta?
Aug 23 13:07:25 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Okay, very.

Aug 23 13:09:50 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Because if you do, then I'm not sure if you're using the word right.  Because that's like someone who gets ideas from lots of places.
Aug 23 13:09:53 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Sorta like
Aug 23 13:09:56 <S>	<Twi`Naga> well read
Aug 23 13:10:34 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Like, liking many different genres of a thing.
Aug 23 13:10:44 <S>	<Twi`Naga> rather than just 1.
Aug 23 13:11:06 <S>	<Twi`Naga> EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT YOU MEANT, DERRAM.
Aug 23 13:11:18 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I'M SURE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN INSULT, BASED ON YOUR TONE.
Aug 23 13:11:24 <S>	<Twi`Naga> BUT YOUR MEANING IS UNCLEAR.
Aug 23 13:11:32 <derram>	Not really
Aug 23 13:11:47 <derram>	just an observation
Aug 23 13:11:58 <S>	<Twi`Naga> What did you mean, though?

Aug 23 13:15:12 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Did you mean it in a sarcastic way, where we don't pick and choose from different scripts, but rather blindly follow a single script that we're told is good.?

Aug 23 14:02:04 <wolfieshy>	you should ask the blog about it

Aug 23 14:03:31 <wolfieshy>	there might be some plots and storylines behind the OC

Aug 23 14:04:34 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Esplin's never played an atari in his life.
Aug 23 14:05:00 <Anitech>	Because he's an oldfag who likes Atari?

Aug 23 19:40:54 <Lord_Ninka>	You do.
Aug 23 19:41:03 <S>	<Viper9172> The people in my rape- I mean friendship basement keep trying to escape. RCR recommened rope. but it doesn't work too well, suggestions?

Aug 23 19:41:15 <Lord_Ninka>	Depends
Aug 23 19:41:22 <Soci|Uni>	using a lock on the door
Aug 23 19:41:25 <Lord_Ninka>	How warm do you want your friends to be?
Aug 23 19:41:44 <Lord_Ninka>	Oh, I guess a lock would be pretty good, too.
Aug 23 19:41:46 <S>	<Viper9172> It's cold as balls down there, for you know, perky nipples
Aug 23 19:42:23 <Lord_Ninka>	Yeah, but, you know... Do you want them to be warm when you friendship them?
Aug 23 19:42:47 <S>	<Viper9172> Yes...
Aug 23 19:43:08 <S>	<Viper9172> I guess I'll go get a lock :L Why didn't I think of that?

Aug 23 19:43:47 <Lord_Ninka>	You didn't think of it because you're too nice
Aug 23 19:43:51 <S>	<Twi`Naga> You could just light the door on fire.
Aug 23 19:44:02 <Lord_Ninka>	You wouldn't want to keep your friends locked in a basement
Aug 23 19:44:21 <S>	<Viper9172> How would that hold them back?
Aug 23 19:44:22 <Lord_Ninka>	But really, it's for their own sake. You are just going to keep them safe.
Aug 23 19:44:45 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Lighting the door on fire keeps my niece in her room when I babysit.  She hates fire.
Aug 23 19:45:22 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I just give her an asbestos-lined sleeping bag, and she's fine.
Aug 23 19:46:11 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Anyways, i saw one of my black friends.
Aug 23 19:46:28 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I chased him and he started running from me, as a joke.
Aug 23 19:46:45 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Then a police officer clothes lined him and held him down.

Aug 23 19:47:57 <S>	<Twi`Naga> It took me a minute to explain that he didn't steal anything from me.
Aug 23 19:48:24 <S>	<Twi`Naga> and we were just goofing around.
Aug 23 19:49:20 <The_Catman_is_Fooding>	I saw a guy chasing a black guy downtown the other day

Aug 23 19:52:01 <Lord_Ninka>	People not helping chase a black man is hilarious
Aug 23 19:52:25 <Lord_Ninka>	But Twi's story was also kind of fun
Aug 23 19:53:24 <Anitech>	That would be awesome.  Black guy running down the street with a white guy chasing him.  As people see it more and more join in on the chase.

Aug 23 19:54:00 <Anitech>	Finally not able to run any farther the black guy stops to call out everyone on the joke.

Aug 23 22:40:07 <S>	<Twi`Naga> "I'm willing to kiss a few frogs in order to find my Prince."  I read it as

Aug 23 22:40:56 <The_Catman_is_Fooding>	I de-dress
Aug 23 22:41:01 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I read it as "I'm willing to fuck a bunch of assholes till I find one I want to keep."
Aug 23 22:41:04 <GabeBearington>	sy jyl ;ucefi ghf diybair?
Aug 23 22:41:10 <S>	<Twi`Naga> or am I just a cynic?
Aug 23 22:41:21 <cheesemoo>	ok
Aug 23 22:41:28 <The_Catman_is_Fooding>	no, that sounds right to me
Aug 23 22:41:32 <cheesemoo>	^
Aug 23 22:41:40 <The_Catman_is_Fooding>	though she might mean it litterally
Aug 23 22:41:47 <S>	<Twi`Naga> heh
Aug 23 22:41:59 <The_Catman_is_Fooding>	or, she might just mean date rather than sex
Aug 23 22:42:02 <S>	<Twi`Naga> or
Aug 23 22:42:03 <S>	<Twi`Naga> OR
Aug 23 22:42:03 <S>	<Twi`Naga> BETTER
Aug 23 22:42:12 <The_Catman_is_Fooding>	honestly, it could go either way easily
Aug 23 22:42:17 <S>	<Twi`Naga> "I'm willilng to fuck a bunch of assholes until one gets me pregnant, and has to stay"
Aug 23 22:42:33 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Because isn't that how it usually happens nowadays?
Aug 23 22:42:39 <cheesemoo>	i bet that's what she meant twi
Aug 23 22:42:41 <The_Catman_is_Fooding>	also possible
Aug 23 22:42:49 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Cheese, I think so too.
Aug 23 22:42:59 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Well, it's probably what's going to happen.
Aug 23 22:43:05 <The_Catman_is_Fooding>	though, what "usually" happens is either restroom abortions, or the guy runs off
Aug 23 22:43:15 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Yeah, that too.
Aug 23 22:43:22 <S>	<Twi`Naga> So
Aug 23 22:44:01 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I think we've got it nailed down to: "I'm willing to fuck a bunch of assholes until one gets me pregnant, so I can experience the magic of restroom abortions."
Aug 23 22:44:14 <S>	<Twi`Naga> THAT'S probably what she meant.
Aug 23 22:44:32 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Should I reply with that quote?
Aug 23 22:44:38 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I think I should.

Aug 23 22:52:26 <S>	<Artful> Uh oh
Aug 23 22:52:37 <The_Catman_is_Fooding>	i've never used anon browsing
Aug 23 22:52:41 <The_Catman_is_Fooding>	why's it matter?
Aug 23 22:52:52 <S>	<Artful> Because I now show up on their profile
Aug 23 22:52:58 <The_Catman_is_Fooding>	and?
Aug 23 22:53:05 <S>	<Artful> Heh
Aug 23 22:53:25 <S>	<Artful> I was browsing the local gay population.
Aug 23 22:53:59 <The_Catman_is_Fooding>	hmm, well, i guess in your situation that could possibly become problematic
Aug 23 22:54:04 <The_Catman_is_Fooding>	but it's unlikely
Aug 23 22:54:40 <S>	<Artful> I hope not XD
Aug 23 22:54:43 <The_Catman_is_Fooding>	especially if you select the option to hide your profile from homophobes
Aug 23 22:54:51 <S>	<Artful> Oh?
Aug 23 22:54:56 <S>	<Artful> How do you do that?
Aug 23 22:55:00 <The_Catman_is_Fooding>	than problems are practicaly nil
Aug 23 22:55:07 <The_Catman_is_Fooding>	uhhh, jas
Aug 23 22:55:41 <S>	<Artful> Wheres the setting for that?
Aug 23 22:56:06 <The_Catman_is_Fooding>	looking for it
Aug 23 22:57:52 <The_Catman_is_Fooding>	huh, well, when you select you orientation on sign up it asks if you want to hide from homophobes
Aug 23 22:58:03 <cheesemoo>	not homophobes necessarily
Aug 23 22:58:04 <The_Catman_is_Fooding>	but i can't find where to change that
Aug 23 22:58:15 <cheesemoo>	it just asks if you want to only be visible to folks who are gay or bi
Aug 23 22:58:27 <cheesemoo>	i don't think it's an option you can change later
Aug 23 22:58:28 <The_Catman_is_Fooding>	is that all it asks?
Aug 23 22:58:31 <cheesemoo>	yes
Aug 23 22:58:41 <cheesemoo>	at least that's what i remember from like a month ago
Aug 23 22:58:44 <cheesemoo>	or whenever
Aug 23 22:58:55 *	Esplin has quit (Ping timeout)
Aug 23 22:59:04 <The_Catman_is_Fooding>	ah well, so there's not really a hide from assholes feature then

Aug 24 14:08:49 <derram>	You can do that 
Aug 24 14:08:53 <The_Catman>	twi is the only important one missing i think
Aug 24 14:08:54 <derram>	find the Twi version
Aug 24 14:09:02 <derram>	twi flip -> mlas1
Aug 24 14:09:13 <derram>	 /allthetables -> mlwtf

Aug 24 14:35:02 <S>	<Twi`Naga> It's like
Aug 24 14:35:09 <S>	<Twi`Naga> from the Pony Anthology
Aug 24 14:35:14 <S>	<Twi`Naga> where she's the space core.
Aug 24 14:35:21 <S>	<Twi`Naga> and is bouncing around the screen
Aug 24 14:35:22 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Remember that?
Aug 24 14:35:48 <S>	<Twi`Naga> It's that, but it says "pony" or "poni" in pink text next to her each time she moves.

Aug 24 15:33:01 <wolfieshy>	Who's that 50s actor who's thin-faced with a bit of a big nose, has a very distinctive voice, I think he might've worn a hat sometimes
Aug 24 15:33:28 <derram>	almost all of them?
Aug 24 15:33:54 <S>	<10z20> martha stwewart

Aug 24 15:37:18 <wolfieshy>	I don't know
Aug 24 15:37:24 <kwulhu>	and a man wearing a hat in the 50's doesn't really narrow it down much 
Aug 24 15:37:25 <wolfieshy>	all I know about him was he was in a black and white tv show
Aug 24 15:37:42 <wolfieshy>	he walked into what I think was a police station and said something loud
Aug 24 15:37:44 <kwulhu>	oh

Aug 24 16:56:42 <Herabek>	It was announced a long time ago
Aug 24 16:57:05 <The_Catman_is_Wat>	well that's just fucking lazy now
Aug 24 16:57:16 <The_Catman_is_Wat>	they skipped the RSE remakes
Aug 24 16:57:27 <Herabek>	meh
Aug 24 16:57:31 <Herabek>	they didn't need remakes just yet.
Aug 24 16:57:38 <Herabek>	Maybe on the 3DS
Aug 24 16:57:47 <The_Catman_is_Wat>	but they skipped right to the BW ones
Aug 24 16:58:04 <Herabek>	I'll probably end up getting it
Aug 24 16:58:06 <The_Catman_is_Wat>	didn't even give them fancy names
Aug 24 16:58:08 <Herabek>	just like I always do

Aug 24 16:59:03 <Herabek>	heh
Aug 24 16:59:11 <S>	<floutsy> Yeah I was really confused by that...they should have made a single new one again...
Aug 24 16:59:12 <Herabek>	I'm fine with that
Aug 24 16:59:21 <Herabek>	I never buy the 3rd version
Aug 24 16:59:24 <Herabek>	even though it's "better"
Aug 24 16:59:27 <Herabek>	because it's mostly the same game

Aug 24 16:59:55 <Herabek>	See

Aug 24 21:45:03 <The_Catman_is_Poni>	never liked ranch sauce myself
Aug 24 21:45:06 <The_Catman_is_Poni>	makes me sick
Aug 24 21:45:09 <S>	<Conky> Pizza places here give you ranch sauce for free, customary
Aug 24 21:45:36 <S>	<10z20> ^
Aug 24 21:45:41 <The_Catman_is_Poni>	hmm, i think a few of the pizza places here give it free
Aug 24 21:45:45 <S>	<10z20> Smaller, family owned places do that here.
Aug 24 21:45:50 <The_Catman_is_Poni>	others charge 10 cents or somethin

Aug 24 21:50:13 <Esplin>	Something the french canadians did right
Aug 24 21:50:21 <The_Catman_is_Poni>	indeed
Aug 24 21:50:41 <S>	<floutsy> I had it my first time when I went up to canada a week ago
Aug 24 21:50:42 <S>	<Conky> If it weren't for that they'd be long gone years ago
Aug 24 21:50:48 <The_Catman_is_Poni>	and chain resturants always do wrong
Aug 24 21:50:58 <S>	<Conky> You only had it at fast food eh?
Aug 24 21:51:08 <S>	<10z20> Does Costco sell poutine in the states?
Aug 24 21:51:15 <The_Catman_is_Poni>	no, i live in canada, it's all over the place
Aug 24 21:51:19 <wolfieshy>	I've never had poutine
Aug 24 21:51:19 <S>	<Conky> You nneeeeeded to have it at a restaurant, and you guys had no beaver tail heh
Aug 24 21:51:26 <S>	<10z20> Here in Ontario Costco sells damn good poutine, often better than in other places
Aug 24 21:51:29 <The_Catman_is_Poni>	but even the canadian branches of fast food joints do it wrong
Aug 24 21:51:35 <S>	<Conky> Costco sells it?
Aug 24 21:51:36 <Esplin>	I get it when I goto canada
Aug 24 21:51:45 <wolfieshy>	I'll eat it if I go to Canada
Aug 24 21:51:46 <S>	<Conky> I didn't know that, never seen it at my costoc
Aug 24 21:51:47 <S>	<10z20> Yeah, Costco sells it and they do a damn good job of it

Aug 24 21:51:59 <The_Catman_is_Poni>	WHEN it was invented
Aug 24 21:52:01 <S>	<Conky> They have great food, it usually surprises me
Aug 24 21:52:09 <S>	<10z20> Gravy is not too tangy, and the cheese curds are really large and tasty
Aug 24 21:52:15 <The_Catman_is_Poni>	and they said Costco is the closest to true poutine they've ever found

Aug 24 21:52:43 <S>	<10z20> Some places I know use a pasta sauce instead of gravy on poutines, it's a fucking injustice
Aug 24 21:52:47 <Esplin>	OH SHIT. IT IS ALL CANADIAN UP IN THIS BITCH.

Aug 24 22:24:15 <GabeBearington>	Wow that was slow.
Aug 24 22:24:30 <GabeBearington>	Google's lossy, lossless, still, animated, and whatever else image format
Aug 24 22:24:56 <The_Catman_is_Poni>	wow
Aug 24 22:25:07 <GabeBearington>	It does it all. And it does it all better
Aug 24 22:25:07 <The_Catman_is_Poni>	that really is master image format

Aug 24 22:25:20 <The_Catman_is_Poni>	at the same time
Aug 24 22:25:31 <The_Catman_is_Poni>	it's like 10-bit video

Aug 24 22:26:07 <The_Catman_is_Poni>	which is worse?

Aug 24 22:26:53 <GabeBearington>	Huhwhat?
Aug 24 22:27:05 <GabeBearington>	adaptation as in people actually using it

Aug 24 22:27:36 <The_Catman_is_Poni>	how long has it been out?
Aug 24 22:27:56 <The_Catman_is_Poni>	to be fair, few people use 10-bit video as well
Aug 24 22:28:09 <GabeBearington>	Everything that matter supports it

Aug 24 22:28:38 <The_Catman_is_Poni>	ai, but not many people USE it
Aug 24 22:28:41 <GabeBearington>	And anime drives 10-bit's adaptation. There's no big thing behind webP except google, and that's not quite enough.
Aug 24 22:29:00 <The_Catman_is_Poni>	hmm, i suppose thats true

Aug 24 22:51:43 <Esplin>	How long do poo breaks last?
Aug 24 22:53:28 <GabeBearington>	Is the poo break longer if the poo is longer or not?
Aug 24 22:53:51 <S>	<Conky> For me?
Aug 24 22:53:58 <S>	<Conky> It depends on  the difficulty of wiping
Aug 24 22:54:09 <Esplin>	Clean poops are best poops
Aug 24 22:54:14 <Esplin>	when it just slides out with minimal mess
Aug 24 22:54:22 <S>	<Conky> Usually a good 5-10 minutes, when I take a poo break, I relax, I unwind

Aug 25 20:01:55 <The_Catman_is_Phone>	They say you can tell the cut of a man by the company he keeps, bullshit. The company you keep is based on geographic convenience as much as any brotherly connection, no, that won't do.
Aug 25 20:01:55 <The_Catman_is_Phone>	We bond over the most tenuous of connections towards no goal or fulfillment, we bond because we can. We can because we laugh together.

Aug 25 20:02:27 <The_Catman_is_Phone>	I bonded with most of you fine folks because people here act like real people. We have emotions and are not afraid to talk about them. We can shoot the shit one minute and be a support group the next. I love all of you guys

Aug 25 21:31:01 <Trips>	wut
Aug 25 21:31:01 <S>	<Artful> Like I want to gift some bandcamp music
Aug 25 21:31:27 <cheesemoo>	http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/ypcln/benders_vs_bronies_charity_challenge_part_1/
Aug 25 21:31:29 <cheesemoo>	basic idea is 
Aug 25 21:31:40 <cheesemoo>	right now the mlp sub is competing with the avatar sub
Aug 25 21:31:48 <cheesemoo>	using BOINC
Aug 25 21:32:06 <The_Catman_is_Kraken>	bandcamp? then just buy it like normal and enter his address to send it to i assume
Aug 25 21:32:14 <The_Catman_is_Kraken>	*email
Aug 25 21:32:38 <Iocaine>	Oh, BOINC -_-
Aug 25 21:32:39 <cheesemoo>	right now we have about double their members, and almost an order of magnitude more points
Aug 25 21:33:37 <cheesemoo>	what matters though is time spent calculating
Aug 25 21:33:46 <cheesemoo>	we're roughly 6.3x their time atm
Aug 25 21:34:00 <cheesemoo>	anyway there are going to be a couple other challenge thingies
Aug 25 21:34:13 <cheesemoo>	winning sub gets to design the reddit logo for a day
Aug 25 21:34:21 <cheesemoo>	also run free ads on reddit for that day
Aug 25 21:34:29 <cheesemoo>	so i am helping
Aug 25 21:34:40 <cheesemoo>	because i want to see what happens when the logo of reddit is MLP
Aug 25 21:34:55 <The_Catman_is_Kraken>	shitstorm?
Aug 25 21:34:58 <magicalhypnotoad>	I can imagine the shitstorm.
Aug 25 21:35:00 <cheesemoo>	:D
Aug 25 21:35:00 <The_Catman_is_Kraken>	i'm thinking shitstorm
Aug 25 21:35:02 <cheesemoo>	^
Aug 25 21:35:07 <S>	<floutsy> There would be so much butthurt
Aug 25 21:35:10 <cheesemoo>	so i've got a couple computers running 24/7
Aug 25 21:35:15 <S>	<Artful> We need it to happen
Aug 25 21:35:16 <The_Catman_is_Kraken>	IT WILL BE GLORIOUS
Aug 25 21:35:20 <S>	<Artful> It must happen
Aug 25 21:35:32 <cheesemoo>	the more we beat them in this round, the less points they get for it
Aug 25 21:35:33 <S>	<floutsy> seriously
Aug 25 21:35:38 <The_Catman_is_Kraken>	well, let me know if we start losing
Aug 25 21:35:42 <cheesemoo>	so you guys should help out
Aug 25 21:35:43 <The_Catman_is_Kraken>	then I'll pich in
Aug 25 21:36:06 <The_Catman_is_Kraken>	for now I've got to use my own processing power/bandwidth
Aug 25 21:36:08 <cheesemoo>	if we only win by a small margin, they would get nearly as many points as us
Aug 25 21:36:14 <cheesemoo>	also
Aug 25 21:36:23 <cheesemoo>	you can just throttle it back to use like 1% of your cpu
Aug 25 21:36:30 <The_Catman_is_Kraken>	i know
Aug 25 21:36:31 <cheesemoo>	all that matters is time spent with the app open and busy
Aug 25 21:36:43 <The_Catman_is_Kraken>	eh, i guess
Aug 25 21:36:50 <The_Catman_is_Kraken>	i might set it up later
Aug 25 21:36:50 <cheesemoo>	do it
Aug 25 21:36:53 <cheesemoo>	filly
Aug 25 21:37:19 <The_Catman_is_Kraken>	i used to have  boinc running all the time, but i've gone through three rebuilds since then
Aug 25 21:38:04 <The_Catman_is_Kraken>	oh gawd popcorn shrimp is fucking amazing

Aug 26 00:01:41 <kwulhu>	same :#
Aug 26 00:01:41 <kwulhu>	:3

Aug 26 00:02:56 <kwulhu>	I played LOAP
Aug 26 00:03:07 <_3p_>	what was loap again?
Aug 26 00:03:14 <kwulhu>	in retrospect, it was weird as hell
Aug 26 00:03:18 <_3p_>	life of a peon?
Aug 26 00:03:19 <kwulhu>	life of a peasant
Aug 26 00:03:22 <kwulhu>	or peon
Aug 26 00:03:31 <kwulhu>	actually, it must have been peasant
Aug 26 00:03:38 <kwulhu>	since you were humans
Aug 26 00:04:37 <_3p_>	I never liked those weird shits
Aug 26 00:04:43 <_3p_>	oh I liked battleships
Aug 26 00:05:47 <kwulhu>	never tried that one
Aug 26 00:06:01 <kwulhu>	didn't wc3 make tower defense popular?
Aug 26 00:06:08 <_3p_>	Starcraft had TDs
Aug 26 00:06:14 <kwulhu>	ah
Aug 26 00:06:18 <_3p_>	wc3 had more elaborate ones though
Aug 26 00:06:44 <_3p_>	sc, the TDs were pretty simple, with only about 3 types of towers
Aug 26 00:06:50 <_3p_>	3-4
Aug 26 00:07:51 <_3p_>	did you ever play sc2 star battle map?
Aug 26 00:08:00 <kwulhu>	that exists?
Aug 26 00:08:04 <_3p_>	that's close to wc3 battleships
Aug 26 00:08:43 <_3p_>	well there's a map for sc2 that you play as a single hero battlecruiser/carrier/or other capital ship
Aug 26 00:09:08 <_3p_>	you upgrade weapons and stuff and battle other player controlled capital ships and need to destroy the mothership
Aug 26 00:09:34 <kwulhu>	that sounds pretty fun
Aug 26 00:09:48 <_3p_>	similar to how wc3's battleship plays, you farm little ships til you get stronger, try to gang up and kill capital shps that are alone
Aug 26 00:10:00 <_3p_>	in sc2, you only get 1 life, no respawn

Aug 26 12:36:46 <Lord_Ninka>	how can that be a new thing that Apple came up with?
Aug 26 12:36:56 <sirtophatte>	is this going to negatively impact my ability to get a great android phone
Aug 26 12:37:05 <Lord_Ninka>	The idea has been there for many years.
Aug 26 12:37:14 <derram>	anything touch related, more than likely
Aug 26 12:39:02 <Lord_Ninka>	It makes no sense.

Aug 26 12:39:56 <sirtophatte>	I wish Apple would burn to the ground
Aug 26 12:40:17 <sirtophatte>	Everyone responsible for Apple's string of lawsuits should be in prison
Aug 26 12:42:13 <Lord_Ninka>	The laws and court system seems pretty stupid, too, on this area.

Aug 26 12:42:34 <Lord_Ninka>	In Apple Inc
Aug 26 12:42:52 <S>	<Sidelong> Call me dumb if you must, but I'm a tad confused, are you saying that Apple owns the rights to all things touch screen? Or are these painkillers fuckin' my head?
Aug 26 12:43:05 <sirtophatte>	Steve Jobs' death should be a national holiday.
Aug 26 12:43:09 <Lord_Ninka>	It's close to that.

Aug 26 12:43:52 <Patton>	I'm going to fuck it
Aug 26 12:43:55 <sirtophatte>	^
Aug 26 12:43:57 <derram>	aparently starting a list over from the beginning once you've reached the end is entirely their idea
Aug 26 12:44:02 <sirtophatte>	paint it pink first
Aug 26 12:44:06 <Lord_Ninka>	Make sure the owner doesn't see you, Patton.
Aug 26 12:44:23 <S>	<Sidelong> Okay. Admittedly, I have an Iphone3, it's shit, and I'm waiting for my 'upgrade' to get a different phone
Aug 26 12:44:26 <derram>	also gestures and icons arranged on a grid
Aug 26 12:44:42 <S>	<Lemontwist> Everything about this makes me sad.
Aug 26 12:45:06 <S>	<Sidelong> When I get a different phone, I'm taking the Iphone skeet-shooting
Aug 26 12:45:09 <S>	<Lemontwist> There's going to be some overlap until someone reinvents the smart phone, and then there will be overlap there, too.
Aug 26 12:45:10 <derram>	eh, I don't like the design anyway 
Aug 26 12:45:17 <S>	<Twi`Naga> woooo!

Aug 26 12:46:04 <derram>	ha
Aug 26 12:46:17 <S>	<Lemontwist> I personally don't like anything related to Apple, and choose Samsung over Apple for my personal choice in phones.
Aug 26 12:46:42 <derram>	we should be moving images projected directly onto the retina anyway
Aug 26 12:46:45 <Lord_Ninka>	I got the idea of a tablet / smart phone when I was about nine years old. I'm sure lots of people did. It's not original at all, it just took some time to make the production cheap and the touch stuff exact.
Aug 26 12:46:54 <sirtophatte>	this is like patenting the idea of a pixel or a square piece of paper

Aug 26 13:14:14 <Lord_Ninka>	Oh, and I think the soap stuff is about 20 cents, but it gives much more than you need, so people always leave half of it. That way, I'd never have to pay

Aug 26 14:35:17 <Lord_Ninka>	Yeah
Aug 26 14:35:19 <Herabek>	always need someone to guide the meat shuttle to cape vagnaveral

Aug 26 14:36:25 <Herabek>	Sorry to hear that ninka
Aug 26 14:36:36 <cheesemoo>	i mean, i think humans would have a somewhat tricky time getting a dick into a vag

Aug 26 14:37:01 <Lord_Ninka>	It's actually a funny sport, cheese
Aug 26 14:37:01 <Herabek>	slightly more challenging
Aug 26 14:37:02 <cheesemoo>	also horses can't actually see what's going on
Aug 26 14:37:07 <Herabek>	but not that hard, if you're hard
Aug 26 14:37:09 <cheesemoo>	so humans would have to do it blindfolded
Aug 26 14:37:15 <Lord_Ninka>	It gets easy fast
Aug 26 14:37:17 <Herabek>	that's the key
Aug 26 14:37:18 <cheesemoo>	you'd probably poke around in there a bit
Aug 26 14:37:36 <Herabek>	we can see what we're up to
Aug 26 14:37:39 <cheesemoo>	also horses seem to be much less articulate when mounting
Aug 26 14:37:48 <cheesemoo>	hard for them to inch forwards/back
Aug 26 14:37:52 <Herabek>	articulate?
Aug 26 14:37:59 <cheesemoo>	uh
Aug 26 14:38:01 <cheesemoo>	flexible? idk

Aug 26 15:35:36 <cheesemoo>	hah
Aug 26 15:35:57 <cheesemoo>	computer vision can be hard
Aug 26 15:36:03 <cheesemoo>	and slow
Aug 26 15:36:12 <cheesemoo>	something like that should be doable quickly though
Aug 26 15:36:48 <sirtophatte>	http://pastebin.com/6m67RTtY yeah, I need to figure out something better than this simplest method possible
Aug 26 15:37:10 <cheesemoo>	oh god you're using AHK?

Aug 26 15:39:26 <Socialery>	and whitepixels
Aug 26 15:39:47 <sirtophatte>	it'll be faster to just check for two white pixels a certain length apart
Aug 26 15:39:50 <sirtophatte>	to indicate a cloud
Aug 26 15:40:56 <Socialery>	also cheese, there are methods in ahk (without using external dlls and the such) to do machine imaging, so you were pretty close
Aug 26 15:41:13 <cheesemoo>	yeah i've read a bit about those
Aug 26 15:41:23 <cheesemoo>	used them myself a little
Aug 26 15:41:25 <cheesemoo>	really basic shit
Aug 26 15:41:29 <Socialery>	someone made an aimbot using them
Aug 26 15:41:31 <cheesemoo>	probably more useful methods

Aug 26 21:41:16 <GabeBearington>	maybe one of my other clients will be better at this

Aug 27 10:23:22 <derram>	I actually think Superman would win that fight
Aug 27 10:23:33 <derram>	what with the invunerable
Aug 27 10:23:55 <derram>	Goku could move faster though 
Aug 27 10:24:59 <derram>	I mean 
Aug 27 10:25:06 <Herabek>	totally terrrible math
Aug 27 10:25:08 <derram>	Superman prolly couldn't touch him for days
Aug 27 10:25:20 <derram>	but Goku'd get tired eventually
Aug 27 10:25:25 <Herabek>	I like the part where holding a blackhole takes less power than destroying the moon.
Aug 27 10:25:30 <derram>	6
Aug 27 10:25:37 *	derram SHIFT KEY!
Aug 27 10:25:48 <GabeBearington>	Someone used E=mc^2 for "energy to destroy something" I bet
Aug 27 10:25:51 <GabeBearington>	whatafaggot
Aug 27 10:25:55 <derram>	Wooo!
Aug 27 10:26:04 <GabeBearington>	~wolf mass of the moon * (speed of light)^2
Aug 27 10:26:06 <Broccoli>	7.3459Ã—10^22 kg c^2  (kilogram speed of light in vacuum squared)
Aug 27 10:26:47 <GabeBearington>	~wolf mass of the moon * (speed of light)^2 in joules
Aug 27 10:27:19 <GabeBearington>	Oh, well, whatever. It's 10^39 that way.
Aug 27 10:28:09 <GabeBearington>	I don't know how the moon is being destroyed here, but unless it's being completely obliterated at the atomic level it will not take an appreciable fraction of that
Aug 27 10:28:23 <GabeBearington>	So they're doing something wrong or the moon is being spectacularly destroyed
Aug 27 10:28:24 <derram>	acutally was
Aug 27 10:28:45 <derram>	a least nothing big enough ever fell
Aug 27 10:29:04 <derram>	I dunno though 
Aug 27 10:29:13 <GabeBearington>	Was it an explosion? Laser? What?
Aug 27 10:29:16 <derram>	I didn't pay much attention to the Doomsday fight 
Aug 27 10:29:20 <derram>	it was 
Aug 27 10:29:31 <GabeBearington>	Also, superman's lazer eye shits and extremely variable power come into this.
Aug 27 10:29:32 <derram>	kinda an exploding laser
Aug 27 10:29:47 <GabeBearington>	Superman's laser eyes can do roughly anything depending on which comic you look at
Aug 27 10:29:57 <derram>	true
Aug 27 10:30:10 <derram>	Really depends on what it takes to hurt him 
Aug 27 10:30:13 <GabeBearington>	We could always just say the black hole sucked in some kryptonite and fucked him up if we wanna justify this.
Aug 27 10:30:32 <derram>	It's a fight between Superman and Goku
Aug 27 10:30:39 <GabeBearington>	But an informed *any* other even remotely powerful person should be fine against superman because tey just get some kryptonite and then rape their shit.
Aug 27 10:30:48 <GabeBearington>	*rape his shit
Aug 27 10:30:51 <derram>	fair fight
Aug 27 10:30:59 <derram>	though not really fair 
Aug 27 10:31:07 <derram>	seeing how he has the Sn
Aug 27 10:31:09 <GabeBearington>	Perfectly fair to get kryptonite; in superman's universe it's apparently EVERYWHERE
Aug 27 10:31:10 <derram>	Sun*
Aug 27 10:31:28 <derram>	but also rare
Aug 27 10:31:34 <GabeBearington>	Rare, but everywhere
Aug 27 10:31:40 <sirtophat>	I have shamed famiry
Aug 27 10:31:45 <sirtophat>	and rebooted linux to try to fix something
Aug 27 10:31:50 <GabeBearington>	any 2 bit villain who happens to be near the end of a comic can find shit
Aug 27 10:32:26 <GabeBearington>	sirtophat, .... you need to use HCL as lube in order to re-earn your lost honour
Aug 27 10:32:55 <GabeBearington>	ahem. HCl ? Hydrochloric acid is what I was going for. I suck at chemistry shit.
Aug 27 10:33:12 <sirtophat>	mountpoints started getting screwey 
Aug 27 10:34:16 <GabeBearington>	okay, that's a bad reason
Aug 27 10:34:19 <GabeBearington>	you should feel bad
Aug 27 10:35:03 <GabeBearington>	I actually did reboot a bit ago because my LC_* were screwy and locale-gen && env-update && source /etc/profile wasn't fixing it somehow
Aug 27 10:37:49 <sirtophat>	seems I could've easily just umount'd it

Aug 27 15:24:22 <S>	<OneOfTheseDaysLuna> follow the seller, or something
Aug 27 15:25:02 <Anitech>	Wow, they started the bidding at .99 GBP
Aug 27 15:25:19 <S>	<Twi`Naga> God damn it.
Aug 27 15:25:24 <S>	<Twi`Naga> This person is taking commissions.

Aug 27 15:25:30 <S>	<Twi`Naga> However
Aug 27 15:25:43 <S>	<Twi`Naga> the regular price is ~$63
Aug 27 15:25:47 <S>	<Twi`Naga> +shipping
Aug 27 15:25:56 <S>	<Twi`Naga> That one just sold for ~$37
Aug 27 15:26:50 <Anitech>	But you could get which ever pony you want.
Aug 27 15:27:01 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I could.
Aug 27 15:27:05 <S>	<Twi`Naga> But it'd be more expensive.
Aug 27 15:27:15 <S>	<Twi`Naga> And I'm not COMPLETELY happy with those plushies.
Aug 27 15:27:27 <S>	<Twi`Naga> If I'm going to commission a plushie, I'd want to be 100% in love with it.
Aug 27 15:27:44 <S>	<Twi`Naga> They're a little too small, imo.
Aug 27 15:27:59 <Anitech>	I can agree with you on that point.

Aug 27 23:00:18 <S>	<Artful> Still tastes bad
Aug 27 23:00:39 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Do shots
Aug 27 23:00:42 <S>	<Twi`Naga> drink it slowly
Aug 27 23:00:46 <S>	<Twi`Naga> or drink it on the rocks
Aug 27 23:00:48 <S>	<Twi`Naga> (with ice)
Aug 27 23:00:52 <S>	<Artful> I dont have shot glasses
Aug 27 23:00:59 <S>	<Artful> I just drink it from the bottle
Aug 27 23:01:02 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Then drink it slowly, or drink it with ice.
Aug 27 23:01:13 <S>	<Twi`Naga> (I just asked my roomates, and that's what they said)
Aug 27 23:01:19 <S>	<Artful> Turn it up and swallow was what I did.

Aug 27 23:02:18 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I wonder how much of being drunk is actually psycological more than anything.
Aug 27 23:02:20 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Because
Aug 27 23:02:31 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I know I've been drinking, and that makes you drunk.
Aug 27 23:02:39 <S>	<Artful> ^
Aug 27 23:02:41 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Does that mean I FEEL more drunk because I think I should?
Aug 27 23:02:48 <S>	<Artful> ^

Aug 27 23:03:16 <S>	<Artful> I felt sleepy
Aug 27 23:03:22 <S>	<Twi`Naga> where people consumed virgin drinks while thinking they were alcoholic
Aug 27 23:03:35 <S>	<Artful> Slightly slowed reaction time
Aug 27 23:03:38 <S>	<Twi`Naga> And they exhibited all the signs of drunkeness
Aug 27 23:03:41 <S>	<Artful> Thats all
Aug 27 23:03:41 <S>	<Twi`Naga> when in actuality
Aug 27 23:03:51 <S>	<Twi`Naga> they hadn't consumed ANY alcohol at all.

Aug 27 23:05:06 <S>	<Artful> I tend to get dizzy when my stomach hurts
Aug 27 23:05:24 <S>	<Artful> Alcohol irritates my stomach like mad
Aug 27 23:05:45 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I think the fact that it's psychological, is also why you can do things normally if you focus on it.
Aug 27 23:06:01 <S>	<Artful> Yup
Aug 27 23:06:03 <S>	<Twi`Naga> As in, if you need to walk in a straight line, you're focusing on doing it so hard, that you actually can.

Aug 28 10:35:52 <Anitech_>	Morning
Aug 28 10:36:00 <MareWithAMember>	How's everyone today?
Aug 28 10:36:06 <sirtophat>	http://xkcd.com/1100/
Aug 28 10:37:17 <S>	<Herabek> has anyone else noticed how often anyone who sells steam games is always very sure to slap DRM next to it? Like, they want you to associate the acronym with steam
Aug 28 10:37:26 <derram>	there hasn't been a post to /r/futashy in 3 months
Aug 28 10:37:27 <S>	<Herabek> it's not un-true
Aug 28 10:37:40 <Anitech_>	It's because noone new can get into it.
Aug 28 10:37:44 <S>	<Herabek> but is smells like they're trying to besmirch steam with the negative connotations that the phrase DRM has
Aug 28 10:37:56 <S>	<Herabek> which is a legitimate strategy, I guess.
Aug 28 10:38:17 <S>	<Herabek> but I only started seeing it in the 6 months to a year
Aug 28 10:38:34 <MareWithAMember>	There's an /r/futashy?
Aug 28 10:38:42 <derram>	it's not really a sub for futashy though
Aug 28 10:38:46 <beerworky>	i'd expect no less
Aug 28 10:38:49 <derram>	well, it is and it isn't

Aug 28 10:38:56 <Anitech_>	I am doing well Mare.  How are you today?
Aug 28 10:39:04 <MareWithAMember>	I am managing, thank you, Ani.
Aug 28 10:39:23 <Anitech_>	If it isn't a sub for Futashy, what is it for then?
Aug 28 10:39:43 <derram>	Novely's mlas1
Aug 28 10:39:52 <derram>	easiest way to word that
Aug 28 10:40:04 <Anitech_>	Novely?
Aug 28 10:40:10 <derram>	A friend
Aug 28 10:41:11 <beerworky>	i thought you were mispelling novelty just to be obtuse
Aug 28 10:41:26 <MareWithAMember>	It would be very nice to have a futa-themed pony sub, but I presume it either already exists and gets no traffic, or else wouldn't get much traffic if someone created it.
Aug 28 10:41:27 <derram>	ha
Aug 28 10:41:32 <derram>	actually did misspell it

Aug 28 10:56:08 <S>	<Twi`Naga> hey
Aug 28 10:56:14 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I just had an idea for a gif/video
Aug 28 10:56:18 <S>	<Twi`Naga> fus ro DASH
Aug 28 10:56:25 <S>	<Twi`Naga> where it's that chibi of RD
Aug 28 10:56:31 <S>	<Twi`Naga> flying across the screen
Aug 28 10:56:34 <S>	<Twi`Naga> remember that?
Aug 28 10:57:00 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I'm what people call an "Idea person"
Aug 28 10:57:10 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I have all these great ideas, but I can't implement them.
Aug 28 10:57:43 <MareWithAMember>	I have those, too. It's very frustrating.
Aug 28 10:58:12 <MareWithAMember>	Although most of my great ideas involve dicks, so maybe I'm just thinking to highly of myself.
Aug 28 10:58:25 <Anitech_>	What video is this?
Aug 28 10:58:47 <Anitech_>	Or I should say what chibi RD are you speaking of?
Aug 28 10:58:55 <S>	<Twi`Naga> the tumblr thing?
Aug 28 10:58:59 <S>	<Twi`Naga> don't know it?
Aug 28 10:59:47 <MareWithAMember>	Wait, is this the blob ponies?
Aug 28 11:00:00 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Yeah
Aug 28 11:00:02 <S>	<Twi`Naga> blob ponies
Aug 28 11:00:04 <S>	<Twi`Naga> that
Aug 28 11:00:10 <Anitech_>	Ahh blob dash.  That I know!
Aug 28 11:06:19 <Anitech_>	lol, while looking for stuff on that I came across something Esplin would like http://elboufon.deviantart.com/art/Chubby-Rainbow-Dash-vector-295867249
Aug 28 11:06:55 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I just had another thought.
Aug 28 11:07:01 <S>	<Twi`Naga> That I thought when you said Esplin.
Aug 28 11:07:22 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Blobby rainbow dash, doing her zoom-across-the-screen thing.
Aug 28 11:07:32 <S>	<Twi`Naga> and flying into a mare's vagina.
Aug 28 11:07:43 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I could see it being done.
Aug 28 11:07:52 <MareWithAMember>	If we're talking Esplin, shouldn't it be an ass?
Aug 28 11:08:00 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Yeah, it should be.
Aug 28 11:08:16 <S>	<Twi`Naga> But the mention of esplin just contributed the sexual connotations.
Aug 28 11:08:28 <MareWithAMember>	And with good cause!
Aug 28 11:15:56 <Anitech_>	So in comic format?  Panel one, RD blob flying along! Panel two, Esplin's surprised face.  Panel three, Esplin looking back towards his ass with the blob stuck in it.  Panel four, Esplin's face with a constipated/straining look.  Panel five, with a pop the blob flys out of his ass to continue it's journey.
Aug 28 11:20:32 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Wait, so you're saying that Esplin fires the blob out of his ass?
Aug 28 11:20:59 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Like, some sort of ping pong ball trick?
Aug 28 11:21:37 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Well, actually, I think the first panel should be Esplin standing or walking or some shit
Aug 28 11:21:51 <S>	<Twi`Naga> and the 2nd panel should be the blob flying into his ass.
Aug 28 11:22:05 <S>	<Twi`Naga> from off screen

Aug 28 12:06:58 <Esplin>	It was just him telling me how bad I should feel for pointing something out and that I am just making myself look bad.
Aug 28 12:07:19 <Esplin>	Please. Esplin has no shame or self respect
Aug 28 12:07:28 <MareWithAMember>	I don't understand. Someone was legitimately trying to say you were bad?

Aug 28 12:48:47 <S>	<Twi`Showa> I was shaving my face, and my balls.
Aug 28 12:48:51 <S>	<Twi`Showa> It was like a jungle down there.
Aug 28 12:48:58 <Lord_Ninka>	That feel when you kick yourself in the nuts
Aug 28 12:48:59 <Lord_Ninka>	Man
Aug 28 12:49:11 <S>	<Twi`Showa> How did you manage that?
Aug 28 12:49:12 <Lord_Ninka>	Why am I so clumsy?
Aug 28 12:49:51 <Esplin>	I've run into the corner of a table with my nuts before
Aug 28 12:49:53 <Esplin>	not fun
Aug 28 12:50:34 <Lord_Ninka>	I was sitting on the couch with my legs up. I adjusted my posture a bit and my right heel collided with my left testicle.
Aug 28 12:50:51 <Lord_Ninka>	crossed legs, you know
Aug 28 12:51:04 <Lord_Ninka>	How, Esplin?
Aug 28 12:51:16 <Lord_Ninka>	Why do you run directly into the corner of a table?
Aug 28 12:51:21 <Esplin>	It was a high table at a fair. I was running and not looking
Aug 28 12:51:28 <Esplin>	horrible odds
Aug 28 12:51:30 <Lord_Ninka>	Oh.
Aug 28 12:52:31 <Lord_Ninka>	That's bad luck

Aug 28 13:01:59 <S>	<Twi`Showa> So
Aug 28 13:02:18 <S>	<Twi`Showa> I started using Old Spice Odor-Blocker Body Wash.
Aug 28 13:02:25 <S>	<Twi`Showa> I feel like I could punch the moon.
Aug 28 13:02:44 <S>	<Twi`Showa> And then the moon would thank me.
Aug 28 13:05:02 <S>	<Twi`Showa> Hey
Aug 28 13:05:07 <S>	<Twi`Showa> you guys have a picture of a pony
Aug 28 13:05:16 <S>	<Twi`Showa> looking pissed off and going "Ffffuuuuu"
Aug 28 13:05:17 <derram>	http://i.imgur.com/wPon1.gif
Aug 28 13:05:31 <S>	<Twi`Showa> Not with her mouth open
Aug 28 13:05:50 <S>	<Twi`Showa> but biting her bottom lip and looking pissed off, and about to say "Fuck"
Aug 28 13:06:21 <S>	<Twi`Showa> and bearing the upper portion of her teeth
Aug 28 13:06:33 <S>	<Twi`Showa> Am I describing it in a way that you understand?
Aug 28 13:06:37 <S>	<Twi`Showa> I'm pretty sure this is an emote
Aug 28 13:06:56 <Lord_Ninka>	It is an emote
Aug 28 13:07:00 <Lord_Ninka>	Just a sec
Aug 28 13:07:06 <S>	<Twi`Showa> kay
Aug 28 13:07:59 <Lord_Ninka>	It's /dashmad on the sub
Aug 28 13:08:07 <S>	<Twi`Showa> Awesome.
Aug 28 13:08:20 <S>	<Twi`Showa> Do we have any other versions for different ponies?
Aug 28 13:08:36 <Lord_Ninka>	Not on the sub

Aug 28 13:08:47 <S>	<Twi`Showa> lame
Aug 28 13:08:51 <Lord_Ninka>	And I haven't seen it on other subs either
Aug 28 13:09:16 <S>	<Twi`Showa> Derram, she's gotta be going like dash is going.
Aug 28 13:09:32 <derram>	ha, that one 
Aug 28 13:09:34 <derram>	so old
Aug 28 13:09:34 <S>	<Twi`Showa> I mean, maybe not EXACTLY like that, but the mouth has to be like
Aug 28 13:09:37 <S>	<Twi`Showa> ffffffuuuu
Aug 28 13:09:54 <derram>	not that I know of 
Aug 28 13:10:03 <derram>	you can try tbp's stuffs

Aug 28 13:12:29 <Herabek>	damn it
Aug 28 13:13:51 <Lord_Ninka>	So, I wrote "hello" to someone and got the answer "Can't talk now, I've got a friend visiting ^^ nomnomnom"
Aug 28 13:13:59 <Lord_Ninka>	Does that mean I wrote to a cannibal?
Aug 28 13:14:09 <Lord_Ninka>	:/
Aug 28 13:15:24 <Lord_Ninka>	Or does nomnomnom mean something else than eating-sounds?
Aug 28 13:15:55 <J-Brony>	Ummm maybe its a "freind"
Aug 28 13:16:11 <J-Brony>	with benefits
Aug 28 13:16:14 <Lord_Ninka>	And you are implying ..
Aug 28 13:16:15 <Lord_Ninka>	oh
Aug 28 13:16:18 <Lord_Ninka>	Hah
Aug 28 13:16:46 <Lord_Ninka>	That would explain it, but still be odd.
Aug 28 13:16:58 <Lord_Ninka>	Best explanation so far!
Aug 28 13:17:02 <J-Brony>	or they are just eating lunch but whatever
Aug 28 13:17:12 <Lord_Ninka>	nah, that's far out.
Aug 28 13:17:21 <Lord_Ninka>	Don't be silly.
Aug 28 13:17:40 <S>	<Twi`Showa> Holy crap.  If you guys don't already, you should try shaving your pubes.  It's all smooth and clean and nice.
Aug 28 13:17:53 <J-Brony>	...
Aug 28 13:17:57 <S>	<Twi`Showa> I've got a freckle that I didn't even know about!
Aug 28 13:17:57 <Lord_Ninka>	lol, Twi
Aug 28 13:18:01 <Lord_Ninka>	Way ahead of you
Aug 28 13:18:08 <Lord_Ninka>	Go shave your ass, too.
Aug 28 13:18:13 <Lord_Ninka>	And legs
Aug 28 13:18:18 <S>	<Twi`Showa> But I can't see my ass.
Aug 28 13:18:20 <Lord_Ninka>	It's a wonderful smooth world :3
Aug 28 13:18:30 <S>	<Twi`Showa> Also, shaving my legs sounds like a terribly arduous task.
Aug 28 13:18:45 <S>	<Twi`Showa> I've tried shaving my chest region, but it's all stubbly when I'm done, and looks like shit.
Aug 28 13:18:58 <Lord_Ninka>	It's only hard at start, it gets faster.
Aug 28 13:19:01 <S>	<Twi`Showa> I did shave my armpits, though.
Aug 28 13:19:07 <Lord_Ninka>	Good
Aug 28 13:19:14 <Lord_Ninka>	armpit hair is hideous.
Aug 28 13:19:36 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I wonder if it'll smell less now that there's no hair there....
Aug 28 13:19:50 <Lord_Ninka>	It probably will.
Aug 28 13:19:59 <S>	PrincessMolestia entered chat
Aug 28 13:20:10 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Also, my dick looks way bigger now.
Aug 28 13:20:11 <derram>	Wooo!
Aug 28 13:20:22 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> Cool.
Aug 28 13:20:26 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I mean, it was already big, but now it's even bigger.
Aug 28 13:20:30 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Because I'm huge.
Aug 28 13:20:36 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> Feelsgoodman
Aug 28 13:20:41 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Some say I'm too huge.
Aug 28 13:20:49 <J-Brony>	LOL Always been a grower not a shower.
Aug 28 13:21:05 <Lord_Ninka>	It's easier to clean and apply antiperspirant properly on a smooth armpit.
Aug 28 13:21:23 <J-Brony>	antiperspirant is bad mojo
Aug 28 13:21:24 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Yeah, I put on deodorant, and it was all smooth and shit.
Aug 28 13:21:26 <Lord_Ninka>	Yeah, endless benefits, Twi
Aug 28 13:21:34 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> Yerp
Aug 28 13:21:39 <Lord_Ninka>	By the way, Twi
Aug 28 13:21:51 <Lord_Ninka>	Don't wear tight pants right now
Aug 28 13:21:53 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Combine all this hair removal with my new old spice body wash
Aug 28 13:21:58 <S>	<Twi`Naga> and I feel like a new person.
Aug 28 13:22:08 <S>	<Twi`Naga> A person who cares about proper hygene.
Aug 28 13:22:12 <S>	<Twi`Naga> It's weird.
Aug 28 13:22:20 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Also, I probably spelled that wrong.
Aug 28 13:22:26 <S>	<Twi`Naga> we should have a spell check bot.
Aug 28 13:22:33 <S>	<Twi`Naga> like !sc hygene
Aug 28 13:22:34 <S>	<Twi`Naga> or something
Aug 28 13:22:42 <S>	<Twi`Naga> sc = spell check
Aug 28 13:22:51 <Lord_Ninka>	Or anything with elastic, you'll get lots of ingrown hairs under the elastic if you wear it right after you've shaved.
Aug 28 13:23:42 <S>	<Twi`Naga> HOLY SHIT
Aug 28 13:23:45 <S>	<Twi`Naga> 1:23
Aug 28 13:23:46 <J-Brony>	"Proper" hygiene.  Your preference is not proper to me.
Aug 28 13:23:49 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> Yep
Aug 28 13:23:51 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> That it is Twi
Aug 28 13:23:52 <S>	<Twi`Naga> LIKE IF YOU'RE EASTERN STANDARD TIME.
Aug 28 13:24:02 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> Mhm.
Aug 28 13:24:08 <S>	<Twi`Naga> No, J-Brony
Aug 28 13:24:09 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I mean
Aug 28 13:24:10 <S>	<Twi`Naga> like
Aug 28 13:24:13 <S>	<Twi`Naga> giving a shit at all
Aug 28 13:24:14 <Lord_Ninka>	I like to shave just before I go to bed, so I can stay naked through the night and my skin will be ready for clothes when I have to wear them
Aug 28 13:24:17 <S>	<Twi`Naga> about hygiene
Aug 28 13:24:33 <Lord_Ninka>	I've got all the advice because I've made all the mistakes. Many times.
Aug 28 13:24:44 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I'm not saying that shaving your dick is the proper way to be clean.
Aug 28 13:25:04 <J-Brony>	Oh well yeah if you never shave your face or trim your beard or not shower then yeah
Aug 28 13:25:06 <S>	<Twi`Naga> However, you should try it at least once.  It FEELS cleaner.
Aug 28 13:25:17 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> Well
Aug 28 13:25:22 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> I;m going to go back to 4chan
Aug 28 13:25:22 <Lord_Ninka>	It feels wonderful
Aug 28 13:25:26 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Pmo
Aug 28 13:25:30 <S>	<Twi`Naga> what part of 4chan?
Aug 28 13:25:33 <Lord_Ninka>	No!
Aug 28 13:25:33 <Lord_Ninka>	Or
Aug 28 13:25:36 <Lord_Ninka>	You can go back
Aug 28 13:25:37 <J-Brony>	They problem is once you do it you need to keep up with it
Aug 28 13:25:42 <Lord_Ninka>	As long as you stay here :3
Aug 28 13:25:48 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> Nowhere in particular
Aug 28 13:25:51 <Lord_Ninka>	not really, J
Aug 28 13:25:54 <J-Brony>	or then IT ITCHES LIKE SHIT
Aug 28 13:25:58 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> Most likely /mlp/ or /r9k/
Aug 28 13:26:08 <S>	<Twi`Naga> mlp is cancer.
Aug 28 13:26:10 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Get it out of here.
Aug 28 13:26:12 <Lord_Ninka>	Only for a week or two then the itching stops.
Aug 28 13:26:27 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> Eh, I'm bored
Aug 28 13:26:29 <S>	<Twi`Naga> How often do you have to shave your crotch?
Aug 28 13:26:31 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> nothing else to do but Tulpaforce
Aug 28 13:26:33 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> and I have a headache
Aug 28 13:26:34 <J-Brony>	I really don't want to itch my crotch all day for 2 weeks thanks
Aug 28 13:26:35 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> so I don't want too
Aug 28 13:26:41 <Lord_Ninka>	Like with a beard. And you can go a week before it starts itching
Aug 28 13:26:51 <Lord_Ninka>	It's not like it itches all the time, J.
Aug 28 13:26:56 <J-Brony>	LOLOLOOLO a week!?!?!?!
Aug 28 13:27:11 <J-Brony>	You bitches got slow ass hair
Aug 28 13:27:15 <J-Brony>	try two days
Aug 28 13:27:16 <Lord_Ninka>	It just itches once in a while
Aug 28 13:27:21 <S>	<Herabek> Mine doesn't really... itch...
Aug 28 13:27:27 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I'm lucky if I have a beard in a 2 weeks. :C
Aug 28 13:27:28 <S>	<Herabek> are you bathing?
Aug 28 13:27:39 <Lord_Ninka>	Not really, my hair grows quite fast.
Aug 28 13:27:43 <derram>	they're talkinga bout shaving
Aug 28 13:27:44 <beerworky>	lool beards what are those
Aug 28 13:27:49 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Herabek, he means that it itches with clothes and shit
Aug 28 13:27:53 <S>	<Twi`Naga> when it's growing back
Aug 28 13:28:06 <S>	<Herabek> what are you wearing that touches your face?

Aug 28 13:28:23 <J-Brony>	not your face....your croch
Aug 28 13:28:28 <S>	<Herabek> Ooh.
Aug 28 13:28:36 <S>	<Herabek> ohkay
Aug 28 13:28:36 <S>	<Herabek> see
Aug 28 13:28:52 <J-Brony>	Neadless to say I keep it trim but I am not the fan of the clean shave.
Aug 28 13:28:53 <S>	<Herabek> I saw ninkas comment about beards and Just assumed
Aug 28 13:28:59 <Lord_Ninka>	Oh, and Twi, I prefer to shave my crotch a bit more often than once a week. I don't always bother, but I feel like the best thing is to do a quick shave every other day instead of doing one big shave rarely.
Aug 28 13:29:06 <S>	<Herabek> waxing strips waxing strips waxing strips waxing strips
Aug 28 13:29:38 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I feel like putting wax on my balls, and then ripping it off
Aug 28 13:29:38 <Lord_Ninka>	I still haven't tried waxing
Aug 28 13:29:41 <S>	<Twi`Naga> would be a terrible idea.
Aug 28 13:29:45 <Lord_Ninka>	But I imagine it hurts like shit.
Aug 28 13:29:48 <S>	<Herabek> it's not that bad.
Aug 28 13:30:04 <Lord_Ninka>	Is it even possible to wax your balls?
Aug 28 13:30:10 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I've got really hairy legs.
Aug 28 13:30:16 <S>	<Twi`Naga> How would I keep up with shaving those?
Aug 28 13:30:17 <beerworky>	what about that hair removal stuff
Aug 28 13:30:21 <beerworky>	forgot what it's called
Aug 28 13:30:21 <J-Brony>	Also I am a hary mother fucker...to do what you guys are talking about (clean everywhere) I would need assistandce...and lots of it
Aug 28 13:30:23 <S>	<Twi`Naga> And if I started shaving my legs
Aug 28 13:30:25 <S>	<Herabek> nair and stuff?
Aug 28 13:30:30 <S>	<Herabek> Do not put that on your balls.
Aug 28 13:30:31 <S>	<Herabek> do
Aug 28 13:30:31 <S>	<Herabek> not
Aug 28 13:30:37 <beerworky>	ah yes that
Aug 28 13:30:42 <S>	<Twi`Naga> how I started shaving my legs, I feel like I'd have to shave my chest aswell.
Aug 28 13:30:43 <beerworky>	it burns? so i've heard
Aug 28 13:30:48 <S>	<Twi`Naga> But shaving my chest always turns out shitty.
Aug 28 13:31:41 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Did I ever tell you guys that I have a scar that stretches from my left side, to about halfway across my back?
Aug 28 13:31:58 <Lord_Ninka>	I had really really hairy legs before I started shaving them years ago and I have no problem keeping up with it.
Aug 28 13:32:14 <Lord_Ninka>	How did you get that scar?
Aug 28 13:32:25 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Heart surgery.
Aug 28 13:32:31 <Lord_Ninka>	Oh.
Aug 28 13:32:35 <S>	<Twi`Naga> when I was a baby.
Aug 28 13:32:37 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I know.
Aug 28 13:32:50 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I usually have a dramatic story cooked up about it
Aug 28 13:32:51 <beerworky>	i don't have enough body hair to worry about
Aug 28 13:32:53 <S>	<Twi`Naga> but I'm lazy right now.
Aug 28 13:32:55 <J-Brony>	Ninka.....is there a reason you feel the need to shave everywhere?  Was it causing you problems?
Aug 28 13:32:57 <beerworky>	peach fuzz and tat's it
Aug 28 13:33:04 <Lord_Ninka>	Well..
Aug 28 13:33:09 <S>	<Twi`Naga> J-Brony, it just feels good.
Aug 28 13:33:19 <S>	<Twi`Naga> also, some girls don't like hairy guys.
Aug 28 13:33:26 <S>	<Twi`Naga> However, I've yet to find a girl who didn't like a swanky beard.
Aug 28 13:33:27 <J-Brony>	some girls do
Aug 28 13:33:41 <Lord_Ninka>	It started out with my girlfriend asking me to shave my legs. I thought "why not?" and did it.
Aug 28 13:33:54 <beerworky>	i think 20-30 years ago girls liked guys hairier
Aug 28 13:34:05 <beerworky>	like the more the better
Aug 28 13:34:15 <Lord_Ninka>	I realised I really liked having smooth legs so I kept doing it.
Aug 28 13:34:20 <J-Brony>	Beer, every girl I've been with has enjoyed it.
Aug 28 13:34:30 <J-Brony>	and I'm only 26 so...
Aug 28 13:34:40 *	beerworky shrugs
Aug 28 13:34:45 <beerworky>	i know nothing about girls so whatever
Aug 28 13:34:50 <Lord_Ninka>	Girls got different tastes obviously
Aug 28 13:34:58 <Lord_Ninka>	Just like we have different tastes
Aug 28 13:35:01 <Lord_Ninka>	>.>
Aug 28 13:35:03 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Is it because you're a homosexual who likes penises and anuses?
Aug 28 13:37:08 <beerworky>	maybe i don't like either
Aug 28 13:37:11 <Lord_Ninka>	To finish the story behind my shaving, I shaved my crotch because I wasn't really sure I liked all that hair. Just to try, you know. And I liked it. The armpits because the hair looked awful and it's easier to keep the smell away when they're smooth.
Aug 28 13:37:40 <Lord_Ninka>	My ass because everything else was so nice to have shaved.
Aug 28 13:38:33 <Lord_Ninka>	So there's the explanation I guess :3
Aug 28 13:39:34 <Lord_Ninka>	It's not as much a need to shave as a preference. I just really enjoy smooth skin.
Aug 28 13:40:16 <beerworky>	so how do you even shave there
Aug 28 13:40:29 <Lord_Ninka>	Smooth legs against smooth legs when you're in bed with someone is also wonderful :3
Aug 28 13:40:40 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> I bet
Aug 28 13:40:42 <Lord_Ninka>	Where? The ass?
Aug 28 13:40:44 <Lord_Ninka>	Uhm.
Aug 28 13:41:09 <Lord_Ninka>	Lying on my back, legs up, looking at a mirror
Aug 28 13:41:53 <Lord_Ninka>	On the bed with something underneath me so I don't get ass hair and stuff on the bed.
Aug 28 13:42:00 <Lord_Ninka>	It really isn't that hard.
Aug 28 13:42:18 <Lord_Ninka>	And I can do a good part of it in the shower, too.
Aug 28 13:43:25 <sirtophatte>	good thing I have two iPod Touches
Aug 28 13:43:31 <sirtophatte>	MLPMusicArchive can't all fit on one
Aug 28 13:43:35 <beerworky>	flexibility is an issue
Aug 28 13:43:38 <beerworky>	what size?
Aug 28 13:45:22 <sirtophatte>	it's rated 32GB but there's only 20 something
Aug 28 13:45:48 <J-Brony>	huh?
Aug 28 13:46:00 <sirtophatte>	I got the second one from someone I know cheap
Aug 28 13:46:10 <J-Brony>	Second what..
Aug 28 13:46:15 <sirtophatte>	iPod touch
Aug 28 13:46:16 <Anilunch>	That's why I will never get rid of my 160GB iPod.
Aug 28 13:46:24 <sirtophatte>	they seriously had those?
Aug 28 13:46:26 <J-Brony>	oh.

Aug 28 13:46:56 <beerworky>	i just use a 16GB sd card for my phone, that's enough music

Aug 28 13:47:12 <Anilunch>	http://www.apple.com/ipodclassic/
Aug 28 13:47:19 <J-Brony>	you can buy a 160gb ipod right now...ipod classic they still sell them
Aug 28 13:48:08 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Okay, so, do any of you know what the fuck "Mudding" is?
Aug 28 13:48:18 <S>	<Twi`Naga> It sounds retarded.
Aug 28 13:48:22 <Anilunch>	Sure you don't get the fancy touch screen and all that, but who cares that's what the iPhone is for.
Aug 28 13:48:36 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Like something rednecks would do in their spare time.
Aug 28 13:48:46 <beerworky>	i actually don't like touch screen too much
Aug 28 13:49:00 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Actually
Aug 28 13:49:00 <beerworky>	especially when you're working out, i like to just press a button to go to the next song
Aug 28 13:49:01 <S>	<Twi`Naga> protip
Aug 28 13:49:11 <S>	<Twi`Naga> We sell most of the old Apple products
Aug 28 13:49:12 <beerworky>	so i can keep the thing in my pocket
Aug 28 13:49:17 <beerworky>	without looking
Aug 28 13:49:38 <S>	<Twi`Naga> if it's not listed on the site, you can still get it by calling the 1-800-AppleCare number
Aug 28 13:49:41 <S>	<Twi`Naga> and they can sell it to you.
Aug 28 13:49:59 <beerworky>	interesting
Aug 28 13:50:03 <S>	<Twi`Naga> We've got access to a special version of the store where we can sell shit that isn't listed on the main website.
Aug 28 13:50:04 <beerworky>	too bad i don't want an apple product
Aug 28 13:50:10 <S>	<Twi`Naga> yeah, just sayin.
Aug 28 13:50:13 <Anilunch>	Not sure whcich mudding you are reffering to.  Is it the type using big trucks?
Aug 28 13:50:15 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Someone said ipod.
Aug 28 13:50:31 <Anilunch>	You work for Apple Twi?
Aug 28 13:50:32 <J-Brony>	So could I get like a macbook from 2008?
Aug 28 13:50:42 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Yeah I do.  Didn't you know that?
Aug 28 13:50:43 <beerworky>	why?
Aug 28 13:50:50 <Anilunch>	That I did not.
Aug 28 13:50:53 <beerworky>	or is this just theoretical
Aug 28 13:51:02 <J-Brony>	Theoretical
Aug 28 13:51:09 <S>	<Twi`Naga> J, I don't actually have access to the store right now, so I don't know all the shit on there.
Aug 28 13:51:20 <J-Brony>	Right
Aug 28 13:51:22 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I usually only go there to sell someone Snow Leopard or Lion.
Aug 28 13:51:39 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Because for whatever reason
Aug 28 13:51:47 <Anilunch>	Yay!  I'm now a college student again!
Aug 28 13:51:48 <S>	<Twi`Naga> you can't buy the old Operating systems anymore
Aug 28 13:51:51 <J-Brony>	I was just kind of curious how far back the stock goes
Aug 28 13:51:51 <S>	<Twi`Naga> unless you call us.
Aug 28 13:51:59 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I'll have to look into it.
Aug 28 13:52:01 <S>	<Herabek> >buy
Aug 28 13:52:12 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I do know that the old ipods are on there.
Aug 28 13:52:13 <beerworky>	with moniez?!?!?
Aug 28 13:52:13 <S>	<Herabek> last time I checked, even leopard has no protection
Aug 28 13:52:18 <S>	<Twi`Naga> like, teh mini ones.
Aug 28 13:52:27 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Also, we don't sell Leopard at all ever ever anymore.
Aug 28 13:52:37 <S>	<Twi`Naga> You literally HAVE to get it from a 3rd party source.
Aug 28 13:52:43 <S>	<Herabek> again
Aug 28 13:53:05 <Herabek>	7:51 PM - Herabek: >buy
Aug 28 13:53:05 <Herabek>	 
Aug 28 13:53:16 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Which is crap, because you'll end up paying around $150 - $200 for the discontinued disks.
Aug 28 13:53:34 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Oh.  Herabek.  I see what you're saying.
Aug 28 13:53:41 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Yeah, just pirate that shit.
Aug 28 13:53:55 <S>	<Herabek> If the company goes out of their way to make it hard to buy software, fuck you
Aug 28 13:53:59 <S>	<Herabek> downloading that shit.
Aug 28 13:54:11 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I know, right?
Aug 28 13:54:14 <S>	<Twi`Naga> It's pretty retardeds.
Aug 28 13:54:57 <S>	<Twi`Naga> HOwever, if you wanted legit disks, you could check out a Fry's electronics.
Aug 28 13:55:06 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I know they have bins full of old software.
Aug 28 13:55:08 <beerworky>	lol legit disks
Aug 28 13:55:12 <S>	<Twi`Naga> might get lucky.
Aug 28 13:55:16 <J-Brony>	LOL I've heard that argument before but the last time I heard it was becasue the hard part about buying it was takeing out your wallet
Aug 28 13:55:18 <beerworky>	imma put it on my wall because they're pretty
Aug 28 13:55:31 <J-Brony>	Not from you herab
Aug 28 13:56:00 <Herabek>	what
Aug 28 13:56:09 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Honestly, I don't give a shit about Apple's shit.  Do whatevver you want.  I'm just giving you the info that we don't tell the public. ;D
Aug 28 13:56:23 <beerworky>	um, thanks?
Aug 28 13:56:47 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I can tell that you're grateful.  Whatever.  Faggot.
Aug 28 13:56:50 <Herabek>	Companies discontinuing products and pulling them from stores kinda counts.
Aug 28 13:57:09 <J-Brony>	oh yeah that counts
Aug 28 13:57:13 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> Welp.
Aug 28 13:57:17 <beerworky>	bai
Aug 28 13:57:21 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Honestly, I'm pretty sure Apple wouldn't care about pirating Leopard, because they literally don't sell it anymore.
Aug 28 13:57:29 <Herabek>	exactly
Aug 28 13:57:35 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> Lool
Aug 28 13:57:37 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I don't know why they don't just offer it as a free fucking download at this point.
Aug 28 13:57:38 <beerworky>	how old is that one anyway?
Aug 28 13:57:38 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> You thought I was going to leave
Aug 28 13:57:40 <Herabek>	They make their money by selling the OS with the computers.
Aug 28 13:57:42 <beerworky>	yes
Aug 28 13:57:55 <Herabek>	and the EULA says you can't install it on non-mac hardware!
Aug 28 13:57:56 <Herabek>	HAHA
Aug 28 13:58:00 <S>	<Twi`Naga> HA
Aug 28 13:58:00 <Herabek>	THAT'LL FLY
Aug 28 13:58:01 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> Well
Aug 28 13:58:01 <S>	<Twi`Naga> HAHAHAH
Aug 28 13:58:09 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> I should set up an area to Tulpaforce anyway
Aug 28 13:58:11 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> so I should go
Aug 28 13:58:20 <S>	<PrincessMolestia> Be back later, I guess
Aug 28 13:58:20 <beerworky>	k
Aug 28 13:58:30 <Herabek>	which, I think, would mean that technically you are violating your EULA by buying ram from a 3rd party.
Aug 28 13:58:34 <S>	PrincessMolestia left chat
Aug 28 13:58:47 <S>	<Twi`Naga> The only difference with Mac's shit is that they have their own file format which they specifically made so their shit wouldn't be compatible with other shit, and vice-versa.
Aug 28 13:58:54 <Herabek>	I think the idea is that it prevents anyone-not-apple from selling a computer designed to work as a mac.
Aug 28 13:59:05 <Herabek>	you mean mac-os journaled?
Aug 28 13:59:15 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Mac Os Extended (Journaled)
Aug 28 13:59:16 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Yes.
Aug 28 13:59:26 <Herabek>	macdvie
Aug 28 13:59:37 <Herabek>	macdrive lets you read those on windows
Aug 28 13:59:43 <S>	<Twi`Naga> nice.
Aug 28 13:59:44 <Herabek>	and there are free NTFS drivers for mac
Aug 28 13:59:53 <Herabek>	It's a good format, actually.
Aug 28 13:59:58 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Those exist because of bootcamp.
Aug 28 14:00:03 <Herabek>	Mm hmm.
Aug 28 14:00:03 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I believe.
Aug 28 14:00:08 <Herabek>	though
Aug 28 14:00:11 <Herabek>	I think some predate bootcamp
Aug 28 14:00:13 <beerworky>	wait, where did you work Twi?
Aug 28 14:00:19 <Herabek>	gay bar
Aug 28 14:00:20 <Herabek>	I mean
Aug 28 14:00:23 <Herabek>	apple tech support
Aug 28 14:00:31 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Not much difference.
Aug 28 14:00:40 <beerworky>	ah
Aug 28 14:00:50 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I mean, everyone is gay for apple.
Aug 28 14:00:52 <S>	<Twi`Naga> so, yeah.

Aug 28 14:04:24 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Oh, I've had quite a few people who don't want to buy the AppleCare Protection plan which gives you 3 years of support for your shit
Aug 28 14:04:32 <S>	<Twi`Naga> because they're just going to buy the new thing next year.

Aug 28 18:50:02 <Anitech>	Is it just a Florida thing or do drivers in every state turn retarded when it rains?
Aug 28 18:51:18 <S>	<Books> Not in Michigan
Aug 28 18:51:27 <S>	<Books> not much, anyway
Aug 28 18:51:32 <S>	<Books> there are retards everywhere
Aug 28 18:52:53 <Anitech>	Speed limit is 70.  On no rain, better drop to 40 and turn on my hazzard lights.
Aug 28 18:53:58 <Anitech>	Not to mention that it is ilegal to have your vechicle in motion with the hazard lights on anyways.
Aug 28 18:58:21 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Well, when it's raining, I always slow down.
Aug 28 18:58:26 <S>	<Twi`Naga> But it doesn't sound like that's the case.
Aug 28 18:59:35 <Anitech>	Well of courseyou have to slow down to match the conditions
Aug 28 19:02:16 <Anitech>	But for a road where people seem to confuse the speed limit signs with the highway number, 40 is excessivly slow and potentially hazardous.

Aug 29 12:20:30 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I like how there is no IE support for the rainbow script.

Aug 29 12:45:34 <GabeBearington>	Shouldn't be manual.
Aug 29 12:45:39 <derram>	updates itself
Aug 29 12:45:46 <derram>	unless you need it RIGHT NOW
Aug 29 12:45:49 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Sweet.  So you can just add that to mlwtf, and it updates automatically?
Aug 29 12:45:50 <derram>	then you can force it
Aug 29 12:45:57 <derram>	nope 
Aug 29 12:46:09 <derram>	he has to update it kinda
Aug 29 12:46:09 <S>	<Twi`Naga> No, I mean, the script download.

Aug 29 12:46:24 <derram>	it updates on your end by itself 
Aug 29 12:46:27 <S>	<Twi`Naga> So, before it can be pushed to us, he needs to fiddle with it?
Aug 29 12:46:29 <derram>	he has to add emotes to it

Aug 29 13:07:30 <sirtophat>	it's not GPU accelerated by default?
Aug 29 13:07:41 <Herabek>	depends
Aug 29 13:07:45 <sirtophat>	I'd expect any 3D rendering to utilize the gpu
Aug 29 13:07:47 <Herabek>	some physics engines rely more on CPU
Aug 29 13:08:10 <Herabek>	rendering and physics calculations aren't the same thing though
Aug 29 13:08:16 <sirtophat>	yeah
Aug 29 13:09:01 <Herabek>	you can actually run physx stuff with the CPU entirely, but it takes ar eally powefful CPU

Aug 29 13:11:15 <Herabek>	I don't know how many it was using
Aug 29 13:11:25 <Herabek>	Just that my framerate dropped to the low 30s

Aug 29 13:13:47 <Anitech>	I runnng the non k version myself.  I din't feel like dealing with overclocking this time around.
Aug 29 13:14:11 <The_Catman>	closed circuit water cooling is relatively risk free
Aug 29 13:14:12 <derram>	I think Hom3r hit the character cap for a self post on the emote table thread
Aug 29 13:14:57 <The_Catman>	a bit trickier to get in the case nicely though

Aug 29 13:15:56 <Herabek>	I looked at a bunch of affordable liquid cooled systems
Aug 29 13:16:08 <Herabek>	and they were like.... 5-8% cooler than the hyper 212p
Aug 29 13:16:18 <Herabek>	and a lot more expensive
Aug 29 13:16:26 <The_Catman>	cool-it's are the best closed ones
Aug 29 13:16:37 <The_Catman>	and not TOO expensive compared to others
Aug 29 13:16:40 <beerworky>	i used to be a computer enthusiast, until i realized how much of a waste of money it is
Aug 29 13:16:51 <beerworky>	for someone who has low standards
Aug 29 13:17:03 <beerworky>	and barely plays games anyway

Aug 29 14:08:58 <Herabek>	DIDN'T MEAN TO OFFEND YOU
Aug 29 14:09:00 <sirtophat>	you could interpret anything as a script

Aug 29 14:09:16 <Herabek>	to be fair
Aug 29 14:09:22 <Socialery>	i can intrpet ur fac as a skript
Aug 29 14:09:24 <Herabek>	scripts generally are for a sequence that doesn't deviate
Aug 29 14:10:25 <Herabek>	that's the thing about unity
Aug 29 14:10:34 <kwulhu>	Is it normal to read C# as C sharp?
Aug 29 14:11:01 <derram>	I don't see how
Aug 29 14:11:07 <derram>	plus tophat is talking 
Aug 29 14:11:11 <Herabek>	I think it is spoken C sharp yes
Aug 29 14:11:19 <derram>	so is J
Aug 29 14:11:43 <Herabek>	I think unity actually can run off uncompiled c# code so you can do live edits
Aug 29 14:11:48 <Herabek>	so it treats it like script
Aug 29 14:11:59 <Herabek>	think
Aug 29 14:12:02 <sirtophat>	why are you pointing out that me and j are talking

Aug 29 15:00:48 <S>	<Books> hosts of weddings decide everything
Aug 29 15:00:50 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Because apparently I'm a best man, according to my girlfriend.
Aug 29 15:00:50 <S>	<Books> it's not a law
Aug 29 15:00:52 <S>	<Books> anything goes
Aug 29 15:01:02 <S>	<Books> some people have more than 1 best man
Aug 29 15:01:04 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Well, according to my friend who is also a best man.
Aug 29 15:01:07 <S>	<Books> some people are strict and morons!
Aug 29 15:01:23 <_3p_>	you can't have 2 best men
Aug 29 15:01:27 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Okay.  Kinda neat!
Aug 29 15:01:31 <_3p_>	how can they both be best?

Aug 29 19:35:32 <S>	<zumarkification> only way to make it better is to get mensrights in there with SRS

Aug 29 19:35:55 <S>	<Books> come on, Mensright's has enough problems

Aug 29 19:41:56 <sirtophat>	yes
Aug 29 19:41:57 <S>	<Books> Which is why it's dumb how feminist society is
Aug 29 19:42:12 <sirtophat>	and feminism has gotten the media to convince everyone that there are no problems for men
Aug 29 19:42:18 <S>	<Books> I don't support the MRM, because I think both genders need attention
Aug 29 19:42:28 <Esplin>	I can't take my niece out to the mall without people thinking I am some pedophile. Which annoys the piss out of me.
Aug 29 19:42:29 <S>	<Books> But i support men's problem's awareness
Aug 29 19:42:48 <sirtophat>	MRM needs to be there because any other equality discussion is always female dominated
Aug 29 19:42:56 <S>	<zumarkification> the world is past militant second wave feminism. you guys should read up on the current scholarly lit, it recognizes that the current structure holds setbacks for each gender.
Aug 29 19:43:10 <S>	<Books> we jsut went through that
Aug 29 19:43:17 <S>	<Books> Both genders are being fucked over in different ways
Aug 29 19:43:26 <S>	<Books> but, feminism is supported way too much

Aug 30 15:41:05 <beerworky>	actually I've only had Cooler Masters, except an Ultra Lanbox
Aug 30 15:41:10 <beerworky>	which is now on the street somewhere
Aug 30 15:41:14 <The_Catman_is_Beverage>	it looks great, but it's a bitch to build in

Aug 30 15:42:43 <beerworky>	it's nice when it's done but it's a fucking pain
Aug 30 15:42:50 <sirtophat>	do it for your country
Aug 30 15:42:51 <beerworky>	anything small is that way
Aug 30 15:43:13 <sirtophat>	if we win this, ponies go on the top of reddit for a day or so
Aug 30 15:43:39 <sirtophat>	the rustling will ripple through the internet for eons
Aug 30 15:43:44 <The_Catman_is_Beverage>	I think the next time i build I'll just use an open workbench or something
Aug 30 15:43:49 <sirtophat>	all jimmies obliterated

Aug 30 15:44:41 <beerworky>	actually, i ran it on a box before
Aug 30 15:44:42 <The_Catman_is_Beverage>	wait, if you win, you design the header for reddit?
Aug 30 15:44:53 <The_Catman_is_Beverage>	like, if RCR wins, RCR designs it?
Aug 30 15:45:11 <beerworky>	so how does part 1 factor in
Aug 30 15:45:12 <RCR>	Most importantly: Whichever team wins the overall competition, their top artist (that is, the artist the admins select) will get to design the site-wide reddit header for their team as well as the advertisement replacement!
Aug 30 15:45:20 <The_Catman_is_Beverage>	DO IT

Aug 30 16:15:04 <beerworky>	I never thought I would need more than 10GB of hard drive space
Aug 30 16:15:17 <beerworky>	as a kid
Aug 30 16:15:32 <Esplin>	I had all my floppies organized by color
Aug 30 16:15:37 <Esplin>	it was fun
Aug 30 16:15:42 <aloysis>	system requirements never occured to me until windows 98
Aug 30 16:15:44 <beerworky>	i use them as ninja stars
Aug 30 16:16:20 <aloysis>	apparently some of our games weren't really supposed to be that damn slow
Aug 30 16:16:23 <beerworky>	i was one of those who liked 98 better than XP when it came out
Aug 30 16:16:34 <Esplin>	I fell in love with XP instantly
Aug 30 16:17:04 <aloysis>	i didn't really get heavy into pc usage until XP anyway
Aug 30 16:17:19 <aloysis>	i mean, i used 98 a fair amount, but mostly after my parents set it up
Aug 30 16:17:29 <beerworky>	so...
Aug 30 16:17:31 <beerworky>	who used ME?
Aug 30 16:17:34 <Esplin>	Windows 3.1 
Aug 30 16:17:38 <Esplin>	Was the first thing I used
Aug 30 16:17:40 <aloysis>	WINDOWS 3. GOD DAMN 1
Aug 30 16:17:50 <Esplin>	My friend had ME
Aug 30 16:17:54 <aloysis>	the first of ours was some dos shell
Aug 30 16:17:55 <Esplin>	He hated it
Aug 30 16:18:00 <aloysis>	pre-windows stuff
Aug 30 16:18:12 <aloysis>	we had windows for workgroups for a while
Aug 30 16:18:26 <aloysis>	and my mom had 98, went to ME, then immediately went back to 98
Aug 30 16:18:35 <aloysis>	or was it 95
Aug 30 16:18:42 <aloysis>	i forget the timeline
Aug 30 16:18:52 <aloysis>	i assume it went 98 to ME
Aug 30 16:19:11 <beerworky>	i think for me it was 95->98->2000->98->XP
Aug 30 16:19:22 <Esplin>	http://i.imgur.com/pTHBO.jpg Look at how fucking happy this man is
Aug 30 16:19:33 <beerworky>	haha
Aug 30 16:19:51 <beerworky>	my school had a copy of windows NT on floppy
Aug 30 16:19:56 <beerworky>	there were 50 floppies
Aug 30 16:19:58 <Esplin>	Haaaaaah
Aug 30 16:20:06 <beerworky>	in a giant box
Aug 30 16:20:21 <Esplin>	It took so long for floppies to phase out
Aug 30 16:20:39 <aloysis>	oh man, XP came out the same year as the 9/11 attacks
Aug 30 16:20:50 <aloysis>	that puts a lot of this in perspective for me
Aug 30 16:20:55 <beerworky>	so old

Despite refusal of some manufacturers to honor the entitlement, it has been enforced by courts in some countries.

Aug 30 17:45:09 <S>	<Twi`Naga> hahaha
Aug 30 17:45:13 <Lord_Ninka>	And that's simply wonderful :3
Aug 30 17:45:41 <S>	<Twi`Naga> See, that's why I wanted to know what you're specifically talking about.
Aug 30 17:45:51 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Because there's more than one thing going on in that post.
Aug 30 17:47:13 <Lord_Ninka>	But your seemingly unprovoked hostility is what makes me shake my head
Aug 30 17:48:05 <Lord_Ninka>	It's like someone is having a conversation, exchanging jokes and laughing at each other
Aug 30 17:48:08 <Lord_Ninka>	And then you come
Aug 30 17:48:14 <Lord_Ninka>	headbut, go!
Aug 30 17:48:37 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I'm hostile towards idiocy.  Which, if the person was serious, I would have been totally justified.
Aug 30 17:49:16 <The_Catman_is_Beverage>	I probably woulda done the same twi
Aug 30 17:49:29 <Lord_Ninka>	That's the wonderful thing

Aug 30 17:50:10 <S>	<Twi`Naga> This person made every indication that they were at least "annoyed" about someone asking about ponies.
Aug 30 17:50:23 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Even in the comments.
Aug 30 17:50:44 <The_Catman_is_Beverage>	it's not so much as eager, as it is conditioned to people being idiots
Aug 30 17:51:04 <The_Catman_is_Beverage>	it becomes so that sometimes you assume idiocy were there really isn't
Aug 30 17:51:10 <The_Catman_is_Beverage>	and then you become the idiot
Aug 30 17:51:12 <S>	<Twi`Naga> >I would have been thrilled if no one had mentioned it in the AMA, but I knew someone was going to.  I was right!  And also pissed.
Aug 30 17:51:13 <Lord_Ninka>	Yeah, but... It's ovenmittbandit.
Aug 30 17:51:31 <S>	<Twi`Naga> That's the comment directly above mine.
Aug 30 17:51:44 <Lord_Ninka>	Yeah
Aug 30 17:51:45 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Does that not imply that this person was annoyed or angry about this whole thing?
Aug 30 17:52:02 <Lord_Ninka>	and a bit above he makes it clear that the post was a joke.
Aug 30 17:52:04 <Patton>	http://i.imgur.com/RI0NL.jpg
Aug 30 17:52:13 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Not quite.
Aug 30 17:52:47 <Lord_Ninka>	Uhm, he links to a video with the words "that is the joke"
Aug 30 17:53:04 <Lord_Ninka>	Anyway, I can see how you got confused.
Aug 30 17:53:08 <S>	<Twi`Naga> See, the person above him was pointing out that it was going to happen anyway, so he was doomed to fail.
Aug 30 17:53:40 <The_Catman_is_Beverage>	Abehd is awesome
Aug 30 17:53:45 <Lord_Ninka>	Yeah, I know it wasn't all clear that it was a joke
Aug 30 17:53:49 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Then oven says "That's the joke".  What *I* was pointing out, was that simply telling people to not do it, is going to make them do it.
Aug 30 17:54:22 <S>	<Twi`Naga> and expecting anything else, is just retarded.
Aug 30 17:54:22 <Lord_Ninka>	But with regards to that
Aug 30 17:54:24 <Lord_Ninka>	Still.
Aug 30 17:54:33 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Point is,

Aug 30 17:54:39 <Lord_Ninka>	It's a joke
Aug 30 17:55:07 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Even after he said "Yeah, that's the joke" he again says that he was annoyed that ponies were mentioned.
Aug 30 17:55:22 <Lord_Ninka>	Who's fighting, Esp?
Aug 30 17:55:31 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I love that gif, esp.
Aug 30 17:55:34 <S>	<Twi`Naga> And this isn't a fight.
Aug 30 17:55:38 <Esplin>	Oh I know
Aug 30 17:55:47 <Esplin>	I am just amused by it all
Aug 30 17:56:06 <S>	<Twi`Naga> It's more like two people who are like "I know what you're saying, but I'm trying to convince you otherwise.  BECAUSE YOU'RE A FAGGOT WHO NEEDS TO BURN IN HELL."
Aug 30 17:56:06 <Lord_Ninka>	Yeah, still I think oven was continuing the joke

Aug 30 17:58:18 <S>	<Twi`Naga> and free medical care.
Aug 30 17:58:34 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Even if that medical care didnt' include penicillin to cure their disease.
Aug 30 17:58:41 <Lord_Ninka>	What makes it funny is that you knew there was a possibility that he wasn't serious and yet you use a hostile tone.
Aug 30 17:58:49 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Ninka,

Aug 30 18:03:47 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Yeah, well, do another alt.
Aug 30 18:03:50 <S>	<Twi`Naga> I'm sure you have more.
Aug 30 18:03:57 <S>	<Twi`Naga> Your body is full of alts.
Aug 30 18:03:58 <Lord_Ninka>	But the caps is the best part ;_;
Aug 30 18:04:07 <Lord_Ninka>	Actually I think I have an alt I could use
Aug 30 18:04:11 <S>	<Twi`Naga> But the caps makes it less believable.

Aug 30 22:45:45 <Zovi>	yes
Aug 30 22:45:52 <kwulhu_>	sure
Aug 30 22:46:05 <kwulhu_>	fugu is fascinating
Aug 30 22:46:14 <kwulhu_>	so much of the fish can fucking kill you
Aug 30 22:49:13 <Anitech>	I love shushi and all but I'm not certain I would ever take the chance on fugu
Aug 30 22:49:54 <The_Catman>	^
Aug 30 22:49:58 <The_Catman>	not worth the risk
Aug 30 22:50:54 <kwulhu_>	apparently it takes years of training to get a license to prepare it
Aug 30 22:51:20 <The_Catman>	i can't believe someone (likely hundreds of people) took the time to figure out which parts of the fish were edible in the first place
Aug 30 22:51:25 <kwulhu_>	yeah
Aug 30 22:51:33 <The_Catman>	if it's highly poisoness, find something else to eat
Aug 30 22:51:35 <kwulhu_>	The procedure is very complicated.
Aug 30 22:51:51 <kwulhu_>	There must have been a lot of trial and error.
Aug 30 22:52:10 <kwulhu_>	But I find it hard to believe that people would eat a toxic fish over and over again.
Aug 30 22:52:18 <The_Catman>	this too
Aug 30 22:52:22 <kwulhu_>	Maybe they tried feeding it to animals as a test.
Aug 30 22:53:23 <The_Catman>	hardly any of it even seems edible
Aug 30 22:53:30 <The_Catman>	it's just so wasteful
Aug 30 22:53:41 <Anitech>	Seriously
Aug 30 22:54:28 <GabeBearington>	http://www.quora.com/Japanese-Cuisine/How-did-the-lethally-poisonous-Fugu-fish-evolve-to-become-a-Japanese-and-Chinese-delicacy
Aug 30 22:54:29 <kwulhu_>	that's what I find interesting
Aug 30 22:54:33 <GabeBearington>	Not that good an answer
Aug 30 22:54:41 <GabeBearington>	mostly "we dunno"
Aug 30 22:57:51 <kwulhu_>	I didn't know that they weren't all lethally poisonous.
Aug 30 22:57:58 <Anitech>	It seems most of the deaths come from people purposfully eating the parts that contain the poison.
Aug 30 22:58:23 <kwulhu_>	I remember reading that most deaths come from amateur preparation.
Aug 30 22:59:27 <The_Catman>	^
Aug 30 22:59:37 <The_Catman>	or greedy ones, who get a little skimpy
Aug 30 23:01:01 <kwulhu_>	I don't think the greedy ones would make it through training to be certified.
Aug 30 23:02:14 <The_Catman>	how would that prevent them from anything?
Aug 30 23:02:54 <kwulhu_>	It would prevent them from being anything but amateur.
Aug 30 23:03:05 <The_Catman>	again, how?
Aug 30 23:03:20 <The_Catman>	being greedy doesn't prevent you from being inteligent
Aug 30 23:04:40 <kwulhu_>	hang on
Aug 30 23:04:57 <kwulhu_>	I think I'm not sure what being greedy does to the fish.
Aug 30 23:05:06 <kwulhu_>	Are you talking about being hasty?
Aug 30 23:06:29 <The_Catman>	no, not hasty
Aug 30 23:06:44 <The_Catman>	just not trimming rather... liberally
Aug 30 23:06:58 <kwulhu_>	lazy?
Aug 30 23:06:58 <The_Catman>	or, rather, doing that
Aug 30 23:07:02 <The_Catman>	not not doing that
Aug 30 23:07:07 <The_Catman>	again, not lazy
Aug 30 23:07:13 <kwulhu_>	wanting more meat?
Aug 30 23:07:24 <The_Catman>	yes

Aug 30 23:07:27 <kwulhu_>	ah
Aug 30 23:07:31 <The_Catman>	no lazy, not hasty
Aug 30 23:07:32 <The_Catman>	greedy
Aug 30 23:07:55 <kwulhu_>	I have a new idea

Sep 26 20:49:23 <gabe>	having to replace mechanical switches is just annoying :/
Sep 26 20:51:40 <Vinyl_Scratched>	season?
Sep 26 20:52:04 <Vinyl_Scratched>	but lol
Sep 26 20:52:05 <Vinyl_Scratched>	me
Sep 26 20:52:07 <Vinyl_Scratched>	heavy usage
Sep 26 20:52:09 <Vinyl_Scratched>	not really
Sep 26 20:52:16 <gabe>	Still, it's important
Sep 26 20:53:19 <Vinyl_Scratched>	i've been using this membrane keyboard for like 2 years in itself
Sep 26 20:53:31 <Vinyl_Scratched>	3 years with a keyboard for me is nothing unusual
Sep 26 20:53:34 <gabe>	Just get a large vat of oil (organic oil.. olive is best), heat it to roughly 70 C, fully submerge the keyboard (careful here, safety is paramount), let the oil completely saturate the mechanical keys by soaking it for around 12 minute minimum. Anything over an hour might be bad though.
Sep 26 20:54:02 <gabe>	And then carefully clean and dry it and you're good to go for a couple decades!
Sep 26 20:54:09 <Vinyl_Scratched>	wut
Sep 26 20:54:11 <S>	MisanthropicCat disconnected from chat
Sep 26 20:54:15 <Vinyl_Scratched>	methinks you trolling me

Sep 26 20:57:15 <gabe>	Don't come crying to me when your keyboard isn't an unusably slick melted mound of plastic.
