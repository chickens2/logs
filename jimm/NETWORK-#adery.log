May 03 05:20:12 <zoonig>	So recently
May 03 05:20:17 <zoonig>	iove been having the recurring nightmare
May 03 05:20:31 <zoonig>	im a young kid
May 03 05:20:39 <zoonig>	and i have a group of friends
May 03 05:20:51 <zoonig>	and wwe find this statue floating above the lake in my yard
May 03 05:21:14 <zoonig>	It doesnt move or anything
May 03 05:21:16 <zoonig>	it just floats there
May 03 05:21:27 <zoonig>	and then we go down and touch it and try talking to it and stuff
May 03 05:21:39 <zoonig>	and then after a few dfays
May 03 05:21:44 <zoonig>	i go down at night and talk to it alone
May 03 05:21:48 <zoonig>	and it whispers stuff to me
May 03 05:21:56 <zoonig>	And then my friends start turning up dead
May 03 05:22:21 <derram>	you have a lake in your yard?
May 03 05:22:28 <zoonig>	I live on a lake, rather
May 03 05:22:34 <zoonig>	It's a gross lake though
May 03 05:22:41 <zoonig>	Its halfway between a lake and a swamp
May 03 05:24:09 <zoonig>	but anyhow, that nightmare has been recurrring lately
May 03 05:24:15 <zoonig>	and its starting to freak me out
May 03 05:24:18 <derram>	sounds like a potential creepypasta

May 03 05:30:03 <zoonig>	A kid talks to a statue and then his friends wind up dead?
May 03 05:30:09 <zoonig>	Maybe the statue posses the kid

May 03 05:31:20 <zoonig>	A lil bit like the ring, but not really
May 03 05:31:28 <zoonig>	fuk u my mind is creative
May 03 05:31:35 <zoonig>	i can make it into something good
May 03 05:32:00 <zoonig>	I'd want the plot to go by strangely, sometimes crawling and sometimes skipping great periods of time
May 03 05:32:05 <zoonig>	Make it feel like an actual dream :^)
May 03 05:32:41 <derram>	well, as long as you leave it to the imagination
May 03 05:33:01 <derram>	explaining that it's a dream would ruin the entire thing

May 03 06:56:09 <zoonig>	Well, i missed you D:
May 03 06:56:57 <Augie>	:3
May 03 06:57:10 <derram>	internet drop out again?
May 03 06:57:25 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	No, just didn't chat.
May 03 06:57:50 <derram>	hah, prototype is on sale for 14 bucks 
May 03 06:57:54 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Apparently Iry-Hor, or Ro, is the earliest human with a known name.
May 03 06:58:04 <derram>	huh, neat 
May 03 06:58:12 <derram>	how'd they find that out?
May 03 06:59:13 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Apparently his existence was debated until they found an inscription about him 2 years ago
May 03 06:59:25 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	datin' back to the 32nd century bc
May 03 07:00:24 <zoonig>	fuck, i need to mopve away from the call of duty trailer
May 03 07:00:32 <zoonig>	ive been reading comments and i think theyre giving me cancer
May 03 07:01:33 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Still haven't watched that. I'd have to turn on my VPN and I"m in the middle of a huge download soooo
May 03 07:01:41 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	it's a face retexture for New Vegas
May 03 07:01:49 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	It looks quite frankly gawgeous
May 03 07:02:01 <zoonig>	doc
May 03 07:02:03 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	and bethesda games had shitty faces anyway
May 03 07:02:16 <zoonig>	its basically call of doritos 2: titanfall revengance
May 03 07:02:32 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	why the doritos and revengeance?
May 03 07:02:48 <derram>	zoo, that trailer didn't show any real info 
May 03 07:03:03 <zoonig>	cuz it looks like they played MSG revengnce and decided to copy it along with titanfall
May 03 07:03:18 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I haven't actually played CoD since WaW, but I might play this one if it turns out decent.
May 03 07:03:20 <zoonig>	and the doritos is cuz its a call of duty
May 03 07:03:24 <zoonig>	It wont
May 03 07:03:26 <derram>	just because there's exoskeletons doesn't mean they're ripping off Titanfall 
May 03 07:03:49 <zoonig>	also the way theyre making chraccters more mobile
May 03 07:04:00 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	It might Zoo, you're not exactly prescient.
May 03 07:04:02 <derram>	I think it depends on how much you liked the last. knew 
May 03 07:04:11 <derram>	last one *
May 03 07:04:24 <derram>	basically just more of the same 
May 03 07:04:30 <zoonig>	Its call of duty
May 03 07:04:53 <zoonig>	The company that owns it has stated they make them for the casuals that wouldnt understand change if they implimented it
May 03 07:04:55 <derram>	there seems to be some superpowers from the exoskeletons  though 
May 03 07:05:14 <zoonig>	So they just rehashthe game cuz they know the dude who tyurns on the xbox at the end of a work day with a beer is who they market to
May 03 07:05:21 <derram>	the wall climbing looked nest 
May 03 07:05:25 <derram>	neat *
May 03 07:06:01 <derram>	I bet it only works on brick walls
May 03 07:11:13 *	derram rolls kwulhu

May 03 07:12:56 <kwulhu>	casuals are people who have better things to do
May 03 07:12:57 <Augie>	DAMNIT WE KNOW IT SUCKS DICK
May 03 07:13:12 *	Dr_Chandragupta_M_s is immediately reminded of aug's age

May 03 07:13:23 <zoonig>	yo auguie

May 03 07:13:39 <zoonig>	shush derryl

May 03 07:13:50 <Augie>	zoonig: :I
May 03 07:13:52 <Augie>	fuck you man
May 03 07:14:04 <kwulhu>	zoonig exaggerates the simplicity of the game
May 03 07:14:06 <zoonig>	yeah kwulhu
May 03 07:14:19 <zoonig>	Meh, not really
May 03 07:14:25 <Augie>	yes
May 03 07:14:32 <zoonig>	only a little
May 03 07:14:37 <kwulhu>	you totally do
May 03 07:14:50 <derram>	I haven't really looked into the series much 
May 03 07:14:51 <kwulhu>	it only seems simple when compared to dota
May 03 07:14:53 <zoonig>	for that style of game, its woefully simple
May 03 07:14:59 <kwulhu>	"for that style"
May 03 07:15:07 <derram>	played modern warfare way back when it hit the ps3
May 03 07:15:09 <kwulhu>	that complex style of game
May 03 07:15:15 <zoonig>	Mhm
May 03 07:15:35 <derram>	it's a decent deathmatch game 
May 03 07:15:45 <zoonig>	add in a lead dev who doesnt understand the game hes devving for
May 03 07:15:56 <zoonig>	and you've got league of casuals
May 03 07:16:19 <derram>	when did that switch happen :I 
May 03 07:16:24 <Augie>	idk
May 03 07:16:40 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Hawkmen consider icarus a cross-dresser.
May 03 07:18:02 <derram>	that's only because he wears a shirt 
May 03 07:18:13 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I've got a test on the urinary system in the morning
May 03 07:18:25 <derram>	human? 
May 03 07:18:31 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	yep.
May 03 07:18:45 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Ahhhh my mod is almost done downloading
May 03 07:20:50 <derram>	sure your laptop can handle the fancier textures 
May 03 07:21:04 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Yep. My laptop's a mean bean machine
May 03 07:21:25 <derram>	my video card went nuts when I added the better backgrounds mod to ftl
May 03 07:21:36 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Wow. Really?
May 03 07:22:34 <derram>	well, the fan went nuts, at least 
May 03 07:22:53 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Also, http://i.imgur.com/9YuIdoF.jpg
May 03 07:22:54 <derram>	actually made me take a vacuum to my desktop 
May 03 07:24:12 <derram>	I can't help but feel that I missed the joke :u
May 03 07:24:36 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Metal Gear Rising's main villian is buitl like that and is prone to yelling "NANOMACHINES, SON!"
May 03 07:25:11 <derram>	that series got silly 
May 03 07:25:31 <derram>	it's on steam, yeah? 
May 03 07:25:45 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	MGR is gleefully silly. I'd say the main series maintained a serious tone with some silly undertones.
May 03 07:25:51 <derram>	I kinda ignored that one since there was no sneaking 
May 03 07:26:14 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	and MGR is on steam.
May 03 07:26:19 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	it's fuckin' amazing.
May 03 07:26:53 <derram>	is there any stealth? 
May 03 07:27:29 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Nah, it's full out hack and slash.
May 03 07:27:30 <derram>	I'd honestly rather sneak around and chop people to bits than just running around doing it 
May 03 07:27:51 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	you might like Far Cry 3 then, derry.

May 03 09:22:22 <BP>	A website that promotes "white pride". Basically, a bunch of complainers who think that the world is against them and that they can't express this aforementioned "white pride" but that all other races can. In fact, if they took the time to talk to normal black/asian/hispanic people, they'd probably realize that these people don't mind them expressing ethnic pride, but instead these "white nationalists" choose to take the example of A SELECT FEW racist minoritie

May 04 02:33:18 <derram>	their histories are so different 
May 04 02:33:23 <A_DISGUSTING_PONY_>	but i suppose thats the only relevant one
May 04 02:33:49 <derram>	bruce saw it happen, but still had a decent childhood, harry lost them before he could think and had a shit childhood
May 04 02:34:23 <Anitech>	Superman also lost his parents.  Don't see him being a whinny emo punk about it.
May 04 02:34:39 <derram>	superman lost his entire race
May 04 02:34:40 <A_DISGUSTING_PONY_>	well that's because harry had like "welp your parents died now you get new SHIT PARENTS"
May 04 02:34:54 <A_DISGUSTING_PONY_>	and batman had "welp your parents died now you get BILLIONS OF DOLLARS"
May 04 02:35:13 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Derram, Harry had weird vague memories of it, plus he had to listen to his mother die everytime he got close to the dementors.
May 04 02:35:24 <derram>	that is true
May 04 02:35:28 <A_DISGUSTING_PONY_>	superman didn't know about his parents until he started saving the world every time he sneezed
May 04 02:35:34 <derram>	but that only happened like 3 times
May 04 02:35:55 <Anitech>	that is true.  Superman did get a fairly normal childhood.

May 04 04:31:42 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I try not to wear socks if I can get away with it. Shoes are foot jail, and the socks are added torture.

May 04 04:31:51 <zooman>	kids these days
May 04 04:32:04 <derram>	socks cut down on foot odor
May 04 04:32:49 <derram>	and keeps your shoes smelling fresher
May 04 04:33:04 <zooman>	doc confirmed for smelly foot boy
May 04 04:33:09 <zooman>	I wouldnt suck your toes if given the chance
May 04 04:34:04 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I prefer sandals, if I can. Winter ruins that though.
May 04 04:34:37 <zooman>	well yeah
May 04 04:34:39 <zooman>	sandals are open
May 04 04:34:44 <zooman>	So socks make no sense
May 04 04:36:56 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	additionally, there's an advantage to being a muslim in this case; the ablution done before prayers include washing of the feet, and I end up doing that around 5 times a day. So that cuts down on smell a little. My barber also said it contributes to my immaculately clean afro, apparently they usually get dirty at around that length.
May 04 04:38:51 <derram>	a lack of sock makes your hair cleaner?
May 04 04:39:30 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Wha? no, the ablution makes it cleaner
May 04 04:43:13 <Supersaw_Hoover>	I dunno socks can be comfy 
May 04 04:43:19 <Supersaw_Hoover>	and you can slide around on floors in them more easily
May 04 04:43:29 <Supersaw_Hoover>	I just find wearing shoes indoors clunky
May 04 04:43:43 <Supersaw_Hoover>	I'd rather be sockfooted or barefoot
May 04 04:43:50 <Supersaw_Hoover>	also fuck pants
May 04 04:43:55 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	This is a personal preference of mine, Supes. Socks, I can never just "not" notice they're there.
May 04 04:44:00 <Supersaw_Hoover>	mmm
May 04 04:44:03 <Supersaw_Hoover>	I get that
May 04 04:44:08 <derram>	I hate wearing sock without shoes :I
May 04 04:44:13 <derram>	socks get dirty so fast
May 04 04:44:23 <Supersaw_Hoover>	where do you walk
May 04 04:44:27 <Supersaw_Hoover>	where that happens
May 04 04:44:43 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I even dislike shoes. I wear them out of necessity because sandals are not all-purpose.
May 04 04:45:11 <Supersaw_Hoover>	I appreciate shoes because I don't like feeling rough or soggy ground
May 04 04:45:15 <Supersaw_Hoover>	it makes me feel uncomfortable
May 04 04:45:20 <Supersaw_Hoover>	I also don't like the feeling of grass on feet
May 04 04:45:24 <Supersaw_Hoover>	I'm one of THOSE people

May 04 06:09:28 <derram>	what's the level cap?
May 04 06:09:46 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	it used to be 81, but now you can keep levelling beyond that.
May 04 06:10:57 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	it was called the "legendary edition" update, added Legendary Difficulty and allowed you to make skill trees Legendary when they reach 100, resetting them to 15 and allowing you to level them up again
May 04 06:11:00 <derram>	I dunno how long the main quest lasts
May 04 06:11:12 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I think the cap is now 567 or something similar
May 04 06:11:16 <derram>	haha
May 04 06:12:10 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	it's fun to have a super OP character and then turn up the difficulty to Legendary so you're on equal grounds with the NPC.

May 04 06:31:53 <sox>	ok i spoofed the comments to look like the hack of nick griffins twitter the other day
May 04 06:32:15 <sox>	i figured it would make a better post referencing recent news than thinking shit up... pasta ftw
May 04 06:32:47 <derram>	well, now you just look insane :I 
May 04 06:32:51 <sox>	hes a nationalist/racist politician, so it was big schadenfreude news
May 04 06:32:57 <derram>	oh, is that what it is 
May 04 06:33:03 <sox>	if it looks real i dont care
May 04 06:33:13 <derram>	hehe, hacked 
May 04 06:33:14 <sox>	i dropped a reference
May 04 06:33:24 <derram>	so he had a shitty password? 
May 04 06:33:29 <sox>	the @nickgriifmep even spelled it the same as the hack
May 04 06:33:35 <sox>	can someone screencap the whole page
May 04 06:34:55 <sox>	pic included
May 04 06:36:20 <sox>	time for coffee
May 04 06:36:28 <sox>	and study
May 04 06:36:44 <derram>	and then my laptop dropped from the wifi as it was uploading :I 
May 04 06:37:12 <derram>	oh, I hit the button :I

May 04 06:38:34 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I bought a nice pair of headphones just now.
May 04 06:38:41 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	~wolf 25 rmb to usd
May 04 06:38:44 <BP>	$3.99  (US dollars) http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=25%20rmb%20to%20usd
May 04 06:38:52 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	they're actually quite good.
May 04 06:39:00 <derram>	yeah, that was 4 bucks when you did it for the controller
May 04 06:39:22 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	they're a pair of Keenion KDM-1003s.
May 04 06:40:14 <derram>	never heard of them 
May 04 06:40:18 <derram>	but, china 
May 04 06:40:24 <sox>	just sayin: mods cant brigade their own subs, if you want i can mod up some of you and you can make some creative changes to the CSS (best to keep everything, but ADD to it)
May 04 06:40:43 <sox>	did you get a nice big monitor screencap of that derram
May 04 06:40:50 <derram>	I could add some css that would get them banned, but I'd rather not risk my account
May 04 06:40:50 <sox>	pic and comments all in
May 04 06:40:56 <derram>	yeah, pmed it to you
May 04 06:41:02 <sox>	i dont want to destroy anything
May 04 06:41:06 <sox>	i want to deface
May 04 06:41:12 <sox>	put ponies in their css
May 04 06:41:22 <sox>	hidden ponies would be amazing
May 04 06:41:26 <derram>	hmmm, could add the random backgrounds 
May 04 06:41:33 <sox>	!!!!!!
May 04 06:41:35 <derram>	with just one pone image 
May 04 06:41:50 <sox>	i'll mod you to do it if you want, although you might wanna mod an alt
May 04 06:41:56 <derram>	hmmm
May 04 06:42:04 <sox>	admins will NOT bend over backwards to help this sub
May 04 06:42:24 <sox>	BUT, if theres a case, then they might complain enough to get a ban
May 04 06:42:43 <sox>	its possible... dont risk your main, they will not IP check who else belongsto the banned account
May 04 06:42:46 <derram>	well, as long as I don't do anything worth banning 
May 04 06:43:00 <derram>	adding ponies isn't enough to warrant a ban
May 04 06:43:02 <sox>	adding CSS which doesnt break rules is fine
May 04 06:43:10 <derram>	derram_2
May 04 06:43:18 <sox>	still the creator of the sub has tried to get people banned before
May 04 06:43:31 <sox>	ill mod derram_2 if that what you want
May 04 06:43:32 <derram>	I could just copy over an old stylesheet from dropbox
May 04 06:43:47 <derram>	yeah, I won't do anything worth banning 
May 04 06:43:54 <sox>	only if youre sre
May 04 06:44:03 <derram>	though, getting the entire sub banned could be fun
May 04 06:44:22 <derram>	eh, the admins wouldn't ban the sub with the evidence 
May 04 06:44:29 <derram>	so yeah, just gonna add ponies
May 04 06:44:29 <sox>	sent... dont do anything destructuve! :3

May 04 06:44:50 <sox>	its funnier for the environment they last logged into to look the same except one minor detail, ponies
May 04 06:45:16 <derram>	oh wow, they have no css
May 04 06:45:27 <sox>	like they cant believe their eyes, header same, sidebar same, whats this hacked by pononymous, ponies in the backgrund.... what
May 04 06:45:45 <sox>	brb
May 04 06:49:00 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	my sound was a bit weird until I set my phone's auto equalizer thingie to "rock". Now everything sounds great.
May 04 06:49:09 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	it's a headset, btw, notj ust headphones.

May 04 06:55:08 <derram>	did a thing 
May 04 06:56:12 <derram>	but it seems like only the bigmac image is working 
May 04 06:56:21 <derram>	and I'm too lazy to look into that
May 04 06:57:57 <sox>	can it just stay on bigmac?
May 04 06:58:14 <sox>	and never change/never try and do others,fail, and display nothing
May 04 06:58:37 <derram>	so you only want it to show big mac on occasion?
May 04 06:58:49 <derram>	or just big mac 
May 04 06:59:44 <derram>	oh hey, apple fritter this time, so it is showing others
May 04 07:00:54 *	Syni_s has quit (Quit: Left chat.)
May 04 07:01:51 <sox>	i changed the sidebar, put celestia in it instead of miley
May 04 07:02:11 <sox>	looks like it works to me
May 04 07:02:30 <sox>	what i meantto say was, will **A** pony appear *every* time
May 04 07:02:47 <sox>	i want the visitor (there wont be many) to def see ponies
May 04 07:03:15 <sox>	its almost subtle
May 04 07:03:20 <derram>	yeah, it'll be a random pony for everyone 
May 04 07:03:27 <derram>	working on another thing now :3
May 04 07:03:52 <sox>	i think the juxtaposition of the original CSS with a few changes works well
May 04 07:05:29 <derram>	http://www.reddit.com/r/BronyH8/comments/24ookb
May 04 07:05:34 <derram>	you have firefox?
May 04 07:08:30 <sox>	yeah
May 04 07:09:33 <sox>	changed the subs "name" to BronyLove
May 04 07:09:55 <derram>	check the comments pages :3
May 04 07:10:22 <sox>	i love the little party cannon pinkie, little bits like that add a nice touch
May 04 07:10:53 <derram>	I changed it to a cupcake nom :3
May 04 07:11:07 <sox>	oh jesus, not quite a subtle, but then it is "hacked" so its all good
May 04 07:11:58 <sox>	i dont see the cupcake
May 04 07:12:37 <derram>	should be where the party cannons were 
May 04 07:14:17 <sox>	how do i hard refresh??
May 04 07:14:23 <sox>	i think its a cache thing
May 04 07:14:29 <derram>	i think I'll fix their banner when I get home 
May 04 07:14:40 <derram>	ctrl +f5
May 04 07:14:59 <sox>	eh, if you uploaded a second one right next to it, so they could restore the old one, that would be ideal
May 04 07:15:17 <sox>	i dont want to actually inconvenience them
May 04 07:15:27 <derram>	well, I was gonna fix it in the css 
May 04 07:15:41 <derram>	they're doing it wrong 
May 04 07:16:03 <derram>	they've got the entire thing uploaded as. their header 
May 04 07:16:11 <sox>	lol
May 04 07:16:20 <derram>	so if you click anywhere on the banner it'll take you to reddit 
May 04 07:16:25 <sox>	if you actually improved their shit that would be funny
May 04 07:16:54 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I love Ninja Sex Party  but I don't really listen to their songs because I like how they sound, in fact the beats / instrumentals and what not are usually pretty bad or ridiculously simple.
May 04 07:16:56 <sox>	after its over you can give them some tips via modmail
May 04 07:16:59 <derram>	I'm headed home in less than an hour, so I'll wait until then to mess with it anymore 
May 04 07:17:09 <sox>	but not until, i dont want to alert them their sub is burning
May 04 07:17:19 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I only really listen to them because I get a giggle out of them.
May 04 07:17:54 <derram>	heh, the lyrics?

May 04 09:16:16 <Drunkplin>	ref pls
May 04 09:16:38 <sox>	i did most of the tweaks, the moderators box mod names changed, their flair changed, the vote button and report button hovers changed, the subs title changed, im about to change the subscribers and subscribers here now to something pony
May 04 09:17:00 <Drunkplin>	ox you glorious fucker
May 04 09:17:06 <Drunkplin>	waiting in the bushes thsis long
May 04 09:17:14 <sox>	i did the header too "LOVE AND TOLERATE EVERYTHING"
May 04 09:17:34 <sox>	it pays off to be friendly with your haters
May 04 09:17:45 <Drunkplin>	change the banner
May 04 09:17:55 <Drunkplin>	they have used that one for ages
May 04 09:18:05 <sox>	i think its the chief visual identity of the sub
May 04 09:18:28 <sox>	so changing it will REALLLLLY change it, not so sure... modifying it from "UPVOTE EVERYTHING" was insidious enough
May 04 09:18:36 <Augie>	 i remember when i was mod for /r/facebookcleveage

May 04 09:20:30 <sox>	absurdity is better than carnage
May 04 09:21:31 <sox>	if we gonna have ppl all up in there in the comments, remember to use emotes :P

May 04 09:24:40 <derram>	and there's no way to have custom sigs
May 04 09:24:53 <derram>	it's just a random image that gets added
May 04 09:25:09 <sox>	if you feel like doing another screecap with the most recent mods, theres not much different but its closer to perfect now, if you wanna do another screencap of the frontpage derram that would be awesome
May 04 09:25:29 <Augie>	well this is my sig from a yoyo forum http://puu.sh/8yMqW.jpg
May 04 09:25:31 <sox>	perhaps i should get the CSS out for making the modlist diplay all the mods
May 04 09:25:51 <sox>	then we can have us in the screencap for a nice famiyl photo sake

May 04 10:27:09 <kwulhu>	okay
May 04 10:27:20 <kwulhu>	ubuntu has three parts
May 04 10:27:32 <Books>	how many is three
May 04 10:27:41 <kwulhu>	um
May 04 10:27:55 <kwulhu>	it's more than two and less than four, and it only has one digit
May 04 10:28:10 <Books>	is it 6?
May 04 10:28:17 <kwulhu>	anyway
May 04 10:29:44 <kwulhu>	it comes from "u", "bu", and "ntu"
May 04 10:31:31 <kwulhu>	"u" means it's a thing, "bu" means it's an abstract noun that is derivative of another word  (kind of like -ness at the end of english words), and "ntu" means it's human
May 04 10:32:13 <kwulhu>	so it's the quality of being human

May 04 10:34:53 <kwulhu>	heh

May 04 10:41:04 <kwulhu>	okay
May 04 10:41:07 <kwulhu>	hang on a second
May 04 10:41:13 *	kwulhu gets up on his soapbox
May 04 10:42:57 <kwulhu>	It's been a popular belief since time immemorial that the *present* is a state of moral decay. People have been remembering golden days (it doesn't matter if they actually existed) for as long as there have been people.
May 04 10:43:20 <kwulhu>	Why is this a popular belief?
May 04 10:44:08 <kwulhu>	It doesn't seem like something people would want to believe. A world that's constantly getting worse is not something you'd want to live in.
May 04 10:44:13 <Books>	species-wide pessimism
May 04 10:44:21 <derram>	this is something you'll understand when you get older 
May 04 10:44:25 <kwulhu>	derram
May 04 10:44:29 <kwulhu>	that was a fake question
May 04 10:44:37 <derram>	serious answer though
May 04 10:44:53 <kwulhu>	"you'll understand when you get older" isn't an answer
May 04 10:44:56 <Books>	^
May 04 10:45:03 <derram>	you'll look back at certain times and think "wow, it was so good back then"
May 04 10:45:04 <kwulhu>	also
May 04 10:45:17 <kwulhu>	errr
May 04 10:45:20 <kwulhu>	this is a little different
May 04 10:45:29 <kwulhu>	this is people being nostalgic about before they were born
May 04 10:45:38 <kwulhu>	basically
May 04 10:45:43 <derram>	basically the same thing but on a societal scale
May 04 10:45:55 <Books>	and stretches farther back
May 04 10:45:59 <Books>	i stand by my awnser
May 04 10:46:03 <derram>	also, ancestor worship
May 04 10:46:20 <kwulhu>	lewronggeneration has always existed
May 04 10:46:28 <kwulhu>	is my point
May 04 10:47:22 <kwulhu>	so
May 04 10:47:57 <kwulhu>	I think part of the allure of this idea
May 04 10:48:09 <kwulhu>	is that it makes you feel better
May 04 10:48:13 <kwulhu>	about yourself
May 04 10:48:21 <kwulhu>	you get to pretend you're the last sane man
May 04 10:48:49 <Books>	by thinking society is bad?
May 04 10:48:59 <kwulhu>	more specific than that
May 04 10:49:16 <kwulhu>	by adhering to standards that were as arbitrary back then as the ones we have now
May 04 10:49:24 <kwulhu>	and THAT'S where we get to linguistics
May 04 10:49:31 <kwulhu>	actually
May 04 10:49:42 <kwulhu>	I feel like I need to make an example
May 04 10:50:05 <kwulhu>	"I don't listen to today's garbage pop. I listen to garbage pop from the 80s."
May 04 10:50:53 <Books>	lots of people like new things, kwu
May 04 10:51:01 <kwulhu>	I know
May 04 10:51:18 <kwulhu>	otherwise it would be impossible for this attitude to exist
May 04 10:51:37 <rss>	[Beatbawx] Books reads comics.: http://redd.it/24p1om/
May 04 10:51:41 <kwulhu>	I guess it's large enough to be a noticeable trend while still not being a majority
May 04 10:51:46 <kwulhu>	anyway
May 04 10:51:52 <kwulhu>	THAT is where we get to linguistics
May 04 10:53:09 <derram>	so what's the desirable time period nowadays?
May 04 10:53:23 <derram>	is it still the leave it to beaver example?
May 04 10:53:54 <Books>	depends on the person
May 04 10:54:00 <kwulhu>	hang on
May 04 10:54:18 <kwulhu>	time period depends on the person^
May 04 10:54:26 <kwulhu>	but let me find this screenshot
May 04 10:55:34 *	Augie sits on kwulhu's head

May 04 11:01:19 <BP>	pronoun | dialect variant of the second-person singular and plural personal pronouns, refers to the person or people being addressed http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=define%20youse
May 04 11:01:30 <kwulhu>	also
May 04 11:01:39 <derram>	the internet is a wonderful thing
May 04 11:01:45 <kwulhu>	"youse" and "y'all" filll gaps we have in english
May 04 11:01:47 <kwulhu>	I mean
May 04 11:01:59 <kwulhu>	it used to be that "you" was plural second person
May 04 11:02:11 <kwulhu>	and "thou" was singular
May 04 11:02:19 <kwulhu>	but then we stopped using "thou"
May 04 11:02:40 <derram>	y'all has been gaining acceptance very quickly

May 04 11:03:24 <kwulhu>	here's the whole thing
May 04 11:03:57 <kwulhu>	part of what I'm seeing
May 04 11:04:10 <kwulhu>	is this insistance that formal english be used in all circumstances
May 04 11:04:27 <kwulhu>	which is ludicrous 
May 04 11:04:37 <kwulhu>	since it's not intrinsically better than any other dialect
May 04 11:05:11 <derram>	you is very rarely used as a plural

May 04 11:09:16 <kwulhu>	anyway
May 04 11:09:32 <kwulhu>	linguists nowadays have a useful term
May 04 11:09:36 <kwulhu>	"prestige dialect"
May 04 11:10:15 <kwulhu>	It's basically how people talk when they want to sound smart and it's seen as the most "correct"
May 04 11:10:46 <Augie>	so like how athiest and sjw's talk?

May 04 11:12:10 <Augie>	~big red
May 04 11:12:10 <kwulhu>	prescriptivists like to insist that there's one correct form of a language, and that all the non-standard dialects and vernacular are derivative and degenerative
May 04 11:12:30 <kwulhu>	they like to use the word "bastardize"
May 04 11:12:39 <Augie>	and patriarchy
May 04 11:12:47 <Augie>	and SHUT THE FUCK UP
May 04 11:12:54 <kwulhu>	in reality, though
May 04 11:13:21 <kwulhu>	many lower-class dialects are just as old as prestige dialects
May 04 11:13:48 <kwulhu>	and the only reason prestige dialects are seen as correct is because rich people and politicians used them
May 04 11:13:51 <kwulhu>	like
May 04 11:13:57 <kwulhu>	there's this really popular aphorism, actually
May 04 11:14:01 <derram>	and teachers
May 04 11:14:17 <kwulhu>	I'd argue that the teachers are instrumental
May 04 11:14:26 <kwulhu>	how did they decide which form of English to teach?
May 04 11:14:39 <kwulhu>	anyway
May 04 11:14:43 <kwulhu>	I really like this aphorism
May 04 11:14:55 <kwulhu>	"A language is a dialect with an army and a navy"
May 04 11:15:22 <derram>	eeeehhhhhhh
May 04 11:15:38 <kwulhu>	it's true
May 04 11:15:43 <kwulhu>	have you ever heard of Piedmontese?
May 04 11:15:50 <derram>	nope
May 04 11:15:54 <kwulhu>	it's a language spoken in Northern Italy
May 04 11:15:58 <kwulhu>	well
May 04 11:16:05 <kwulhu>	at least linguists call it a language
May 04 11:16:10 <kwulhu>	Italians say it's a dialect of Italian
May 04 11:16:12 <derram>	I'm thinking if american dialects vs the english language 
May 04 11:16:44 <derram>	yeah, I can't understand half of what some people say, but they're still speaking english 
May 04 11:16:50 <kwulhu>	meanwhile
May 04 11:17:11 <kwulhu>	Swedish and Norwegian are different languages
May 04 11:17:34 <kwulhu>	even though Swedes and Norwegians can understand each other quite well without needing to study each other's languages
May 04 11:18:16 <derram>	I wonder what that sounds like to them
May 04 11:19:00 <kwulhu>	Italians call piedmontese a dialect because the elite in Italy speak Standard Italian
May 04 11:19:00 <Augie>	is's this's thes happys funs times?

May 04 11:20:05 <kwulhu>	I think it might gain more recognition as a language
May 04 11:20:17 <kwulhu>	really
May 04 11:20:17 <derram>	does the language show up in their writing?
May 04 11:20:23 <kwulhu>	not sure
May 04 11:20:25 <Augie>	i think so
May 04 11:20:32 <kwulhu>	a lot of the times, you only write in formal dialects
May 04 11:21:30 <kwulhu>	I men
May 04 11:21:31 <kwulhu>	mean
May 04 11:21:41 <kwulhu>	there is a way to write in Cantonese, for example
May 04 11:21:44 <Augie>	if you a speaka like dis
May 04 11:21:52 <kwulhu>	but for things where you actually have to write

May 04 11:23:31 <kwulhu>	before nation-states
May 04 11:23:44 <kwulhu>	all languages were on a sort of gradient from town to town

May 04 11:26:44 <kwulhu>	it's nice to have a lingua franca

May 04 11:35:19 <kwulhu>	it also degrades every time you use it

May 04 11:36:51 <kwulhu>	this commenter brings up the perfect point
May 04 11:36:52 <derram>	ya know, there was prolly space, just no way to access it fast enough
May 04 11:36:55 <Augie>	then someone can cut eh tape

May 04 11:37:23 <kwulhu>	the fact that somebody is actually using a figure of language

May 04 11:39:02 <kwulhu>	hah
May 04 11:39:24 <kwulhu>	I know a guy who says "arguably", or "granted" before almost every statement
May 04 11:39:29 <kwulhu>	it pisses me off
May 04 11:39:34 <derram>	hehe
May 04 11:40:05 <derram>	my mom says "ya know?" after almost every sentence 
May 04 11:40:14 <kwulhu>	hah
May 04 11:40:33 <kwulhu>	also
May 04 11:40:55 <kwulhu>	"know what I'm saying" is REALLY good for people who use a lot of figurative language

May 04 20:19:29 <zooman>	Booklets, i played a full campaign
May 04 20:19:38 <Booklets>	I've played hours and hours of both
May 04 20:19:41 <kwuphone>	they're not required, though
May 04 20:19:53 <zooman>	you could play D&D mostly silent, as well
May 04 20:20:01 <Booklets>	You can not
May 04 20:20:07 <Augie>	^
May 04 20:20:08 <Booklets>	It would be a challenge

May 04 20:20:18 <kwuphone>	not any good campaign
May 04 20:20:21 <Booklets>	You probably played with shitty people
May 04 20:20:22 <Augie>	thats like playing csgo without mics or dota without communcation
May 04 20:20:32 <zooman>	The DM couldnt be silent, i guess
May 04 20:20:35 <kwuphone>	well
May 04 20:20:36 <zooman>	But the players could

May 04 20:20:54 <kwuphone>	the talking is ABOUT the game
May 04 20:20:59 <zooman>	Yeah, because thats what made it resemble a fun game
May 04 20:21:00 <kwuphone>	in D&D the talking is the game
May 04 20:21:06 <zooman>	:^)
May 04 20:21:08 <Booklets>	Zoo

May 04 20:21:25 <Booklets>	You have not played enough DND to know what you're talking about
May 04 20:21:29 <zooman>	but no it was about 50% combat and story
May 04 20:21:38 <Booklets>	So just stop
May 04 20:21:38 <kwuphone>	pretending to be retarded is only clever if it's actually funny
May 04 20:21:56 <kwuphone>	D&D combat sucks
May 04 20:22:00 <zooman>	Man, sometimes i forget how defensive D&D fags can get 
May 04 20:22:09 <kwuphone>	"defensive"
May 04 20:22:15 <Booklets>	I don't even play it anymore

May 04 20:22:22 <Booklets>	You're just incorrect
May 04 20:22:29 <zooman>	I understand the game fully
May 04 20:22:48 <zooman>	Im just saying that magic requires as much social interaction as D&D does
May 04 20:22:53 <Booklets>	Nope
May 04 20:22:56 <Booklets>	I'm done
May 04 20:23:00 <kwuphone>	that's the battle cry of somebody who's getting called out.on his. bullshit and doesn't have a case

May 04 20:24:04 <kwuphone>	I feel sorry for you being in your terrible D&D party, zooman. It's the only explanation for why you're this wrong.
May 04 20:24:33 <zooman>	kwuphone, the campaign was entertaining enough, it wasnt the players
May 04 20:25:26 <zooman>	i played with dudes who have been playing for ~10 years, and the DM was pretty damn good

May 04 22:45:44 <terra>	okay if he says explicitly he's going to kill himself, cops
May 04 22:45:54 <terra>	it sounds like a shitty thing to do but it will probably save his life

May 04 22:47:21 <terra>	ask him if he wants to die by the pills
May 04 22:47:28 <terra>	if he says yes then its a good idea
May 04 22:47:34 <Scix_s>	He stopped replying
May 04 22:47:38 <terra>	you wanna call the local police station, not non emergency
May 04 22:47:39 <terra>	do it then

May 04 22:48:14 <terra>	i dismissed a friend's suicidal thoughts as nothing
May 04 22:48:22 <wobki>	if they are drunk and belligerant they might just get arrested by some dick cops
May 04 22:48:30 <wobki>	its a dick move unless your 100 percent sure
May 04 22:48:38 <Scix_s>	fuck
May 04 22:48:48 <Scix_s>	the police non emergency is 311
May 04 22:48:57 <Scix_s>	does that work anywhere, or only in that city?
May 04 22:49:01 <terra>	dont clal non emergency

May 04 22:51:14 <terra>	for suicidal shit its no joke
May 04 22:51:17 <wobki>	cops dealing with a drunk and possibly high person?

May 04 22:52:27 <terra>	like, what charges can you get from that, honestly
May 04 22:52:33 <Echo>	a minor is pretty shit
May 04 22:52:39 <Echo>	depending on the state
May 04 22:52:44 <wobki>	depends if they yell at the cop, if they are underage, if the cop is a complete douchebag
May 04 22:52:50 <wobki>	it all depends on a lot of shit
May 04 22:53:03 <AttackTheMoon>	oh :(
May 04 22:53:09 <wobki>	if they have any illegal substances out in the open
May 04 22:53:09 <terra>	yeah but on a suicide case they're touchy with  it

May 04 22:54:45 <wolfieshy>	@ Echo
May 04 22:54:52 <terra>	but you need to listen to gut instinct to call or not
May 04 22:54:55 <Echo>	depends how serious he is about it
May 04 22:55:00 <terra>	i ignored mine and didnt make a call
May 04 22:55:01 <wobki>	right?
May 04 22:55:05 <Echo>	I had to call on my friend once
May 04 22:55:16 <wobki>	if someone is like "im going to kill myself right now" and they keep saying shit like that, then it might be a good idea
May 04 22:55:26 <wobki>	but someone who is like "ugh im drunk and im gonna take some pills"
May 04 22:55:32 <wobki>	that doesnt sound like a suicidal person
May 04 22:55:35 <wobki>	just a drunken idiot
May 04 22:55:36 <Echo>	^
May 04 22:55:43 <wobki>	and besides, most pills most people can get? wont kill you
May 04 22:55:57 <Echo>	speaking of drunken idiots, my coworkers cancelled on me so I'm going to go get smashed with you guys instead
May 04 22:56:11 <wobki>	you cant od on tylenol or sleeping pills without literally taking like 2 bottles worth
May 04 22:56:14 <Echo>	well they might kill you but they'll do it slowly and painfully to punish you for being an idiot
May 04 22:56:27 <wobki>	xanax wont kill you either
May 04 22:56:33 <wobki>	same thing with most anti depressants
May 04 22:56:37 <wobki>	most pills wont kill you
May 04 22:56:44 <wobki>	youll just be sick for a day or two
May 04 22:56:49 <wolfieshy>	what about cyanide
May 04 22:57:00 <Echo>	tylenol is actually very toxic at relatively low levels, but what it does is completely kill your liver leaving you alive and in pain for days without medical care, much longer with medical care
May 04 22:57:16 <terra>	again, gut feeling
May 04 22:57:18 <wobki>	yeah your gonna die anyway from tylenol
May 04 22:57:21 <terra>	if scix feels that he needs to call
May 04 22:57:24 <terra>	then he needs to
May 04 22:57:25 <Echo>	it's hard to get a high enough level of cyanide to kill you
May 04 22:57:31 <terra>	you dont wanna ignore your gut
May 04 22:57:36 <Echo>	personally the only way I'd go is with an exit bag or a gunshot
May 04 22:58:08 <terra>	i appriciate the idea of an exit bag

May 04 23:13:19 <terra>	i like pot better than alcohol
May 04 23:13:29 <wolfieshy>	I like a pot of coffee better 
May 04 23:13:46 <terra>	something satisfying about smoking
May 04 23:14:08 <wobki>	coffee is for plebs
May 04 23:14:14 <wolfieshy>	someone convinced me to do it once and I didn't really feel it 
May 04 23:14:16 <wobki>	pot is the one true god.

May 04 23:14:36 <wolfieshy>	also don't want it to show up on tests
May 04 23:14:43 <wobki>	why
May 04 23:14:45 <wobki>	fuck those tests
May 04 23:14:55 <wobki>	nobody has the right to control what you do in your own free time
May 04 23:15:08 <terra>	i didnt feel it cuz i didnt hold the smoke in
May 04 23:15:25 <terra>	if you need to do a test, go sober for a month and then save your piss
May 04 23:15:45 <wobki>	why a month
May 04 23:15:57 <RainbowPonySemen>	just drink a lot of water before test
May 04 23:15:57 <terra>	just to be safe
May 04 23:15:58 <RainbowPonySemen>	ez pz
May 04 23:15:59 <wobki>	weed is out of your system in 7 days if you dont smoke several times a day every day

May 04 23:16:24 <wobki>	except today i havent smoked at all
May 04 23:16:27 <terra>	why did i add this shit to my drink
May 04 23:16:28 <wolfieshy>	well that's for normal tests
May 04 23:16:29 <RainbowPonySemen>	weed is for loser nerds
May 04 23:16:29 <AttackTheMoon>	weed makes you kill children
May 04 23:16:31 <wolfieshy>	what about the hair tests
May 04 23:16:33 <terra>	this ruined the arnold palmer
May 04 23:16:56 <terra>	wolfieshy: not even the gov uses hair tests
May 04 23:17:11 <wobki>	the hair test (which is ungodly expensive and pretty much no one does unless you kill someone at work or in the gov)
May 04 23:17:27 <wobki>	the hair tests shows whatever drug you have done since that hair has been there
May 04 23:17:34 <wobki>	so usually atleast 6 months to a year
May 04 23:17:41 <wolfieshy>	you're invalidating my excuses for being a stick in the mud 
May 04 23:17:43 <terra>	they cost like 150 bucks to use

May 05 04:27:59 <derram>	yeah, I just kinda looked at one of the comments and closed the tab
May 05 04:28:22 <Backup_s>	Should have read the post itself
May 05 04:28:37 <Backup_s>	No question about it, there are lots of nubs in ranked solo queue. I suggest valve makes an advanced competency test for players who want to play highly skilled ranked matches. Requirements should include; proficiency in 70% of heroes in the pool, 1000+ dota 2 hours minimum, an iq test that requires players to pass with at least a score of 120 or higher, proficient knowledge of the English language.
May 05 04:28:37 <Backup_s>	Make a test for all of these things before being able to join the higher tier solo ranked matchmaking.. once taken it would unlock the ability to join that queue permanently. Any other ideas you guys think that would work?
May 05 04:29:32 <derram>	well, if you drop the last two it's a good idea
May 05 04:29:45 <derram>	and a thousand hours does seem a bit high
May 05 04:29:46 <Backup_s>	The last two are there, though.

May 05 08:54:03 <derram>	are you normally right handed, chandra?
May 05 08:54:22 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I'm terrible at everything with both hands
May 05 08:54:26 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	but it depends on the action
May 05 08:55:36 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I can only write righthanded, but I normally pick stuff up and kind of naturally do things left handedly. Usually though I'm at least OK with righthanded sports stuff, but for ping pong I just can't do it righthanded
May 05 08:59:27 <Supersaw_Hoover>	I'm left-handed but use my mouse right-handed and play kb stepmania right handed
May 05 08:59:59 <Supersaw_Hoover>	stepmania is so integral to my life that it's included up on the list with writing
May 05 09:00:11 <Supersaw_Hoover>	shit
May 05 09:01:44 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	my handwriting is shit, but I feel like if I practiced writing lefthanded it'd look better than my best righthanded handwriting
May 05 09:01:48 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I'm gonna do that
May 05 09:01:48 <derram>	I didn't know you wrote stuffs
May 05 09:01:56 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I'm gonna practice lefthanded writing
May 05 09:02:04 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Supes, you write?
May 05 09:05:55 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	my english teacher told me that she and her partner (before specifiying that it was her fiancee) write published lesbian fiction under a pen name. That's how I found out in one fell swoop that she was an engaged lesbian and published author. Never got the pen name though.
May 05 09:07:25 <derram>	in china?
May 05 09:07:37 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	no, US.
May 05 09:11:16 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	From checking her facebook page, it looks like she married one of the other teachers. Never had this teacher but I saw her around
May 05 09:11:35 <derram>	huh, always thought that was frowned upon 
May 05 09:15:51 <Books>	let em frown.

May 05 09:19:46 <Books>	anyone who calls anyone "sir" in casual conversation gotta go to hell
May 05 09:21:44 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I know people who say "sir" just as a verbal tick. Not to sound refined or some shit like that, but because it's just what comes to mind
May 05 09:22:44 <Books>	fair enough. I know people that do that
May 05 09:22:53 <Books>	"thank you sir" and shit

May 05 13:12:54 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	They estimated 7 - 12 days.
May 05 13:12:55 <derram>	that's actually not too bad
May 05 13:12:59 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	So I'm happy.

May 05 13:13:30 *	kwulhu hugs Princess_Twi`Naga_s 
May 05 13:13:44 <wobki>	are you planning on breaking into places or stealing cars?
May 05 13:14:03 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	>stealing cars with a tubular lockpick
May 05 13:14:08 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Are you fucking stupid, Krashie?
May 05 13:14:26 <wobki>	yes
May 05 13:14:38 <kwulhu>	stupid is her waifu
May 05 13:14:41 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	I'm sorry, that in itself was a stupid question, because the answer is obvious.
May 05 13:14:44 <wobki>	i dont know what the fuck a tubular lock pick is for. i dont break into shit.
May 05 13:14:52 <wobki>	but its obviously for picking locks
May 05 13:14:54 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Also, why the hell does swift keep inviting you back?
May 05 13:15:00 <kwulhu>	hey
May 05 13:15:04 <kwulhu>	she's been good recently
May 05 13:15:07 <wobki>	http://www.dhgate.com/product/dhgate/150305815.html/?utm_source=pla&utm_medium=GMC&utm_campaign=lifebest&utm_term=150305815&f=bm%7c150305815%7c112010-VehicleTools%7cGMC%7cAdwords%7cpla%7clifebest%7cUS%7c112010002-DiagnosticTools%7cc%7c%7c0LRF%7c&gclid=CMKXroSklb4CFQEaOgod8xEA2w this tubular lockpick is for cars
May 05 13:15:08 <kwulhu>	don't ruin this
May 05 13:15:33 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	That's the site I got mine from.
May 05 13:15:48 <wobki>	so why do you need a lockpick
May 05 13:15:52 <wobki>	what are you breaking into
May 05 13:15:58 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Although the one you linked is actually a cheap lockpick.  The one I bought is a namebrand lockpick that I got for super cheap.
May 05 13:16:23 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Because I like picking locks as a bit of a hobby.
May 05 13:16:33 <wobki>	lol
May 05 13:16:38 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Never had a tubular one before, so I've been looking into getting one.
May 05 13:16:51 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Also, I don't wanna pay for laundry >.>
May 05 13:16:59 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	because that's expensive.

May 05 13:21:17 <wobki>	well good luck with t
May 05 13:21:24 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	All I'm going to do is open the top panel that leads to the maintenence section, pull a tab that puts the washer into maintenence mode for one load.
May 05 13:21:49 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	The neat thing about tubular lockpicks
May 05 13:21:54 *	Monoclebear has quit (Quit: Leaving)
May 05 13:22:01 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	is that you can lock the pick into the setting for a lock that you've just picked.
May 05 13:22:03 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	if that makes sense.
May 05 13:22:12 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	What that means is that the lockpick is basically a key at that point.
May 05 13:22:20 <wobki>	yeah
May 05 13:22:24 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	You can also take it to a locksmith to have a key made.
May 05 13:22:33 <wobki>	because that wont look suspecious
May 05 13:22:45 <wobki>	so you can break into like pay phones and shit with that thing, thats pretty cool
May 05 13:22:46 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	People do it all the time for lockboxes that they've lost the key to.
May 05 13:22:57 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Except that would be stupid, Krashie.
May 05 13:23:12 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	And those usually use AceII locks which are much more difficult to pick with a tubular lock.
May 05 13:23:19 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	You'd have more luck with traditional methods.
May 05 13:23:33 <wobki>	you cant break into payphones
May 05 13:23:37 <wobki>	they are super hard
May 05 13:23:47 <kwulhu>	payphones?
May 05 13:23:54 <kwulhu>	I haven't seen one of those in a while
May 05 13:24:08 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Niether have I.
May 05 13:24:16 <wobki>	yeah and i imagine most people dont use coins in them anymore, just phone cards
May 05 13:24:17 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Well, actually, there's a long line of them at the mall.
May 05 13:24:26 <wobki>	but in the 90's... man you could get bank out of them
May 05 13:24:49 <kwulhu>	so
May 05 13:25:01 <kwulhu>	what's your favorite non-UN-recognized state?
May 05 13:25:06 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	The only thing that makes me sad, is the locking widget for this lockpick requires one of those little hexigonal bars
May 05 13:25:11 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	and it didn't come with one. :c
May 05 13:25:14 <kwulhu>	I like Abkhazia
May 05 13:25:21 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	So I'm going to have to find my own set.
May 05 13:25:36 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	It's probably in a closet or some shit
May 05 13:25:53 <kwulhu>	either that
May 05 13:25:54 <kwulhu>	or um
May 05 13:26:07 <kwulhu>	maybe Transnistria
May 05 13:26:21 <derram>	what happened to the one that got internet famous a couple months ago
May 05 13:26:38 <kwulhu>	Sealand?
May 05 13:27:08 <derram>	the lady with the microphones
May 05 13:27:09 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Also, krashie, as for taking the lockpick to a locksmith
May 05 13:27:23 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	I could also just write down the settings of the pins and get a key made off of that.
May 05 13:28:05 <wobki>	thats cool
May 05 13:28:15 <kwulhu>	I have no idea what you're talking about, derram 
May 05 13:28:26 <wobki>	ive never used a lockpick. just something like bolt cutters, or a crowbar.
May 05 13:28:57 <derram>	pretty sure Twi was linking pictures of her
May 05 13:29:17 <derram>	I don't remember what her position was, but she was everywhere

May 05 13:43:08 <kwulhu>	and they all work off conventions other people made
May 05 13:43:22 <kwulhu>	like having Poland's flag upside-down
May 05 13:43:55 <kwulhu>	and putting a rice farmer hat on Indonesia to distinguish it from the upside-down Polish flag
May 05 13:44:24 <kwulhu>	hah
May 05 13:44:29 <kwulhu>	I just realized something
May 05 13:44:52 <kwulhu>	Georgia's a proudly christian country in  an area of the world with a lot of Muslims
May 05 13:44:57 <kwulhu>	look at their flag
May 05 13:45:04 <kwulhu>	it has FIVE CROSSES on it 
May 05 13:45:07 <kwulhu>	it's so perfect
May 05 13:45:08 <kwulhu>	like
May 05 13:45:13 <kwulhu>	one cross would have been enough
May 05 13:45:15 <kwulhu>	but no
May 05 13:45:29 <kwulhu>	they had to put crosses in the four sections too
May 05 13:45:36 <kwulhu>	to show how Christian they were
May 05 13:45:52 <kwulhu>	also
May 05 13:45:57 <kwulhu>	Georgia has its own alphabet

May 05 18:44:46 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	so
May 05 18:44:59 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	I tested out my tubular lockpick on the tubular locks I've got lying around.
May 05 18:45:10 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	couldn't open a single one of them.
May 05 18:45:19 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	It was rather disheartening.
May 05 18:45:30 <Augie>	why do you have those?
May 05 18:45:40 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	So I looked up a video on this particular model of lockpick, and found one of a guy unboxing and testing it.
May 05 18:45:46 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Turns out I was missing a piece!
May 05 18:46:08 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	The little pin that you're supposed to stick into the end of the lockpick
May 05 18:46:16 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	It's detachable.
May 05 18:46:37 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Mine was sitting under the little bit of foam they've got inside the plastic case the lockpick comes in.
May 05 18:46:47 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	along with the decoder key.
May 05 18:46:51 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	*pin decoder key
May 05 18:47:15 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	So I stuck the pin into the slot where it goes, and suddenly my locks are opening up with no problem!
May 05 18:47:21 <fionna>	Princess_Twi`Naga_s: areyou good at lockpicking?

May 05 21:31:41 <kwulhu>	I used to correct people on that too

May 05 21:32:04 <zooman>	I just dont think vidya is a medium where sexuality needs to be accurately represented, or represented at all
May 05 21:32:07 <Sparkles>	Saying you COULD care less gives me no information, besides that you care at lease a little bit
May 05 21:32:15 <kwulhu>	yes
May 05 21:32:15 <Sparkles>	Zooman, you're wrong
May 05 21:32:18 <zooman>	I do care a little bit
May 05 21:32:24 <zooman>	But only a very small amount
May 05 21:32:39 <Sparkles>	So say "I don't care all that much"
May 05 21:32:42 <kwulhu>	but in the context of a culture in which "I could care less" means "I don't care much", he's giving you all the information you need
May 05 21:32:51 <zooman>	^
May 05 21:32:59 <zooman>	I could care less doesnt mean i couldnt care less
May 05 21:33:04 <Sparkles>	That culture is fucking stupid and I will correct people on it until I die
May 05 21:33:11 <zooman>	Its putting the stress on could
May 05 21:33:14 <kwulhu>	prescriptivism is dangerous
May 05 21:33:15 <Lyra>	seems sensible enough to me
May 05 21:33:22 <zooman>	so like "i COULD care less"
May 05 21:33:26 <zooman>	implying i could, but only a little
May 05 21:33:29 <Lyra>	it leaves a little bite in a way being explicit doesn't
May 05 21:33:33 <kwulhu>	also
May 05 21:33:38 <zooman>	But anyhow
May 05 21:33:48 <zooman>	Sexuality in vidya almost overwhelmingly doesnt matter
May 05 21:33:48 <kwulhu>	"I couldn't care less" is hyperbole anyways

May 05 21:34:10 <Saltbearer>	this 
May 05 21:34:21 <Sparkles>	zooman, that's like saying sexuality in movies, books, music, and art doesn't matter
May 05 21:34:28 <Sparkles>	It's narrow minded and idiotic
May 05 21:34:32 <Saltbearer>	ttttthhhhhhiiiiiiiisssssddddddfcbbhbnkkl

May 05 21:35:11 <kwulhu>	a helpful chart for music formats
May 05 21:35:12 <zooman>	Sparkles, in every medium aside from games, it matters more
May 05 21:35:20 <kwulhu>	remember
May 05 21:35:29 <kwulhu>	vinyl is best because it's the least convenient
May 05 21:35:30 <Sparkles>	Back that claim up
May 05 21:35:34 <Sparkles>	I fucking dare you
May 05 21:35:39 <zooman>	But in games instead of just taking the medium in, youre interacting
May 05 21:35:56 <zooman>	So characterization is done differently
May 05 21:36:16 *	kwulhu waits
May 05 21:36:21 <kwulhu>	I'm not even gonna take a side on this
May 05 21:36:26 <kwulhu>	I wanna see what sparkles says
May 05 21:36:53 <zooman>	And half the time, the gameplay aspect is much, much more important than the storytelling
May 05 21:37:02 <Sparkles>	That's a load of shit
May 05 21:37:07 <Sparkles>	Look at Morrowind
May 05 21:37:08 <zooman>	So if a character would be gay, it doesnt matter either way
May 05 21:37:18 <Sparkles>	Morrowind is a terrible fucking game
May 05 21:37:26 <zooman>	Well, i wouldnt go that far
May 05 21:37:30 <Sparkles>	But it's most people's favorites because of the story
May 05 21:37:33 <zooman>	gamepay in every elder scrolls game sucks
May 05 21:37:35 <Sparkles>	I've played that shit, it's awful
May 05 21:37:40 <Sparkles>	It's almost unplayable

May 05 21:38:07 <tara>	no
May 05 21:38:09 <kwulhu>	morrowind has the shittiest combat ever
May 05 21:38:14 *	SGIG is now known as zooman
May 05 21:38:16 <kwulhu>	but the setting and story are really nice
May 05 21:38:29 <zooman>	Morrowind combat isnt all that worse than the other TES games, though
May 05 21:38:38 <kwulhu>	:I
May 05 21:38:41 <kwulhu>	that's fucking retarded
May 05 21:38:43 <zooman>	The following, i should say
May 05 21:38:48 <kwulhu>	yeah
May 05 21:39:06 <kwulhu>	I'm just gonna miss this cliff racer 10 times in a row at point blank
May 05 21:39:08 <kwulhu>	no biggies
May 05 21:39:17 <Sparkles>	Back to the topic at hand please
May 05 21:39:23 <kwulhu>	just gonna hold down the attack button
May 05 21:39:27 <kwulhu>	not like timing matters
May 05 21:39:50 <zooman>	Sparkles, whatever
May 05 21:40:00 <zooman>	i dont know what else there is to say
May 05 21:40:05 <zooman>	Lets just say that youre right
May 05 21:40:15 <kwulhu>	zooman pleads "no contest"
May 05 21:40:19 <Lyra>	I award zooman one point
May 05 21:40:27 <zooman>	and that characters sexuality is literally th most important part of every video game
May 05 21:40:35 <kwulhu>	what
May 05 21:40:37 <Lyra>	I withdraw my point
May 05 21:40:38 <kwulhu>	he never said that
May 05 21:40:41 <Sparkles>	No one ever said that you idiot
May 05 21:40:42 <Carlos>	evening

May 05 21:40:48 <Sparkles>	Go away Carlos
May 05 21:40:52 <Carlos>	nty
May 05 21:40:54 <kwulhu>	no, zooman
May 05 21:40:55 <wolfieshy>	I accuse mario of being a communistsexual
May 05 21:40:57 <kwulhu>	that wasn't even clever
May 05 21:41:01 <kwulhu>	that was just dumb
May 05 21:41:18 <wolfieshy>	so the series diverges when lim n-> inf > 1 OR when lim n->inf = inf
May 05 21:41:18 <zooman>	Im just saying hes making it seem more important than it really is
May 05 21:41:25 <kwulhu>	actually, here's the thing, zooman
May 05 21:41:28 <wolfieshy>	thanks calculus book
May 05 21:41:31 <zooman>	If  game has a well written gay character, cool
May 05 21:41:33 <wolfieshy>	I didn't realize infinity was great than one
May 05 21:41:35 <zooman>	if theyre straight, cool
May 05 21:41:39 <zooman>	Doesnt matter
May 05 21:41:40 <AttackTheMoon>	WHOO!
May 05 21:41:45 <AttackTheMoon>	finished my historiography
May 05 21:42:00 <Sparkles>	It could very well matter! 
May 05 21:42:07 <wolfieshy>	I think photons don't matter either 
May 05 21:42:19 <kwulhu>	you say a lot of stupid stuff unironically. We can't TELL when you're trolling since you seem exactly the same when pretending to be dumb.
May 05 21:42:20 <zooman>	have you ever tried to fuck a proton, wolfieshy 
May 05 21:42:33 <Sparkles>	If the game is built around learning about a character, and he's gay, then that is one very important facet to explore
May 05 21:42:37 <zooman>	kwu you dont know that
May 05 21:42:52 <wolfieshy>	those are very different things zooman 
May 05 21:42:54 <AttackTheMoon>	i want more gay/female protags in vidjas
May 05 21:42:58 <AttackTheMoon>	makes it more interesting
May 05 21:42:58 <kwulhu>	I can't be certain
May 05 21:43:11 <kwulhu>	but I'm 90% sure
May 05 21:43:12 <kwulhu>	plus
May 05 21:43:24 <zooman>	Maybe im entirely different than the persona i portray here, and everything ive ever said has been fabricated
May 05 21:43:24 <kwulhu>	somebody who's always pretending to be an idiot might as well be an idiot

May 06 07:06:09 <derram>	I do hear about that one all the time, though 
May 06 07:06:17 <derram>	maybe there's mods to pretty it up
May 06 07:07:50 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	It's not that its ugly, it's that hte first world you're on is boring

May 06 07:15:13 <derram>	tough love
May 06 07:15:36 <derram>	did it just not work at all or was there an animation for it?
May 06 07:15:59 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	it didn't work at all. No button prompt or anything

May 06 07:21:34 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	It's so good. Are all versions of the game directors cut now? because the directors cut version is better
May 06 07:21:57 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	it has things like allowing you to defeat bosses with stealth and things like that
May 06 07:23:01 <scriptea>	WAIT

May 06 07:23:40 <derram>	mine doesn't say anything about a director's cut, unfortunately 
May 06 07:23:44 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	yeah, that was originally only in the Wii U version of the game before they brought it to the PC version
May 06 07:23:58 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Hmmm maybe it's not listed but still installed, like a patch?
May 06 07:24:11 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	or maybe it's a purchasable expansion :|
May 06 07:25:18 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	yeah, it's a cheap upgrade for the PC version if you already have the game
May 06 07:25:30 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	basically DLC to fill in some of the game's voids
May 06 07:25:50 <derram>	on sale for 10 bucks right now

May 06 08:57:10 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	in far cry 3, if you don't have any syringes when you try to heal, you heal with a visceral animation of things like breaking your thumb back into place or digging bullets out with a knife.
May 06 08:57:19 <wolfiesalt>	I have a file called gardevoir paizuri.swf
May 06 08:57:26 <wolfiesalt>	it's ren and stimpy dancing to some kind of music

May 06 11:26:25 <Augie>	i missed the old teen titans
May 06 11:26:30 <Augie>	and young justice
May 06 11:26:44 <Books>	i liked Brave and the Bold
May 06 11:26:52 <Augie>	i like that too
May 06 11:27:03 <Books>	the last episode was talking about it getting replaced with a different batman show
May 06 11:27:07 <Books>	little meta for me, but i liked it
May 06 11:27:41 <Augie>	i would be pissed if they remade ed edd n eddy
May 06 11:27:55 <Augie>	and completely change the style
May 06 11:28:09 <Augie>	and did the same shit too teen titans go
May 06 11:28:30 *	Augie prays that it doesnt happen
May 06 11:28:32 <Books>	teen titans go isn't a relacement for the teen titans
May 06 11:28:40 <Augie>	it's a parody?
May 06 11:28:48 <Books>	basically
May 06 11:29:00 <Books>	it's a different version
May 06 11:29:21 <Augie>	the 4kids versoin
May 06 11:29:22 <Books>	sometimes if you like cartoons a lot you forgot that some cartoons are made for a different audience
May 06 11:29:23 <Augie>	version
May 06 11:29:24 <derram>	it would've been great as shorts at the end of a serious show
May 06 11:29:28 <Books>	you are not the target audience
May 06 11:29:33 <Books>	that's nota  flaw of the show
May 06 11:29:49 <derram>	too weak to stand on its own
May 06 11:29:53 <Augie>	so the target audices is 6 year olds
May 06 11:29:58 <Augie>	to get into comic books?
May 06 11:30:02 <Books>	and ed edd n eddy was always pretty shitty to me
May 06 11:30:11 <Augie>	i liked it books
May 06 11:30:12 <Books>	it's not trying to get them into comic books
May 06 11:30:13 <derram>	not really, because they reference their own canon 
May 06 11:30:19 <Augie>	plank was the best charecter
May 06 11:30:24 <derram>	it's made for fans of the show
May 06 11:30:32 <Augie>	~yt plank my best friend

May 06 11:30:44 <Books>	trying to mix in the old tv show with a new take for newer, younger audiences
May 06 11:31:07 <Books>	weird idea, but the original teen titans was super successful
May 06 11:31:13 <Augie>	yes
May 06 11:31:29 <Augie>	i was sad when they stoped young justice
May 06 11:31:39 <Augie>	so it was replaced with teen tiants go
May 06 11:31:42 <Books>	it was also a comic book
May 06 11:31:48 <Books>	started in 2008
May 06 11:32:01 <Books>	wait, ended in 2008
May 06 11:32:03 <Books>	started in 2003
May 06 11:32:11 <Books>	teen titans go
May 06 11:32:22 <Augie>	it was an idea for a long time
May 06 11:32:27 <Books>	YJ got cancelled for stupid reasons
May 06 11:32:49 <Augie>	books: they got cancelled for not selling enough toys or some shit like that
May 06 11:32:52 <Books>	because tv shows exist to increase sales in toys, and someone else is put in charge of the toys
May 06 11:33:13 <Books>	the toys were poorly made, so they didn't sell as well as they hoped
May 06 11:33:22 <derram>	I didn't like that robin much anyway :I
May 06 11:33:43 <Books>	the show was written fine and had enough fanbase, but that's not the reason shows are given more seasons
May 06 11:33:48 <Books>	not to tv shows like that anyway
May 06 11:34:06 <Augie>	mostly toys
May 06 11:34:08 <Augie>	if sold
May 06 11:34:10 <Augie>	more show
May 06 11:34:22 <Books>	that's why a lot of shows exist.
May 06 11:34:24 <Augie>	inb4 how my little pony works
May 06 11:34:34 <Books>	mlp is only still going because people keep buying the toys
May 06 11:34:43 <Books>	like, literally, the only purpose it serves is to increase toy sales
May 06 11:34:44 <Augie>	>the cheply made toys
May 06 11:34:54 <Books>	so they can be sold for cheap
May 06 11:35:00 <Augie>	the real good toys are made by the fans
May 06 11:35:07 <derram>	not entirely 
May 06 11:35:08 <Books>	since the target audience usually isn't rich as balls
May 06 11:35:10 <Augie>	or the vinyl series
May 06 11:35:27 <Books>	it would be stupid to sell $100+ toys in stores for mlp as the average toy
May 06 11:35:34 <Books>	that's just inneffective
May 06 11:35:45 <Books>	of course they're cheaply made
May 06 11:35:48 <Augie>	i mean they could atleast make it look like the toys is from the show
May 06 11:35:53 <Augie>	or near to it
May 06 11:35:54 <Books>	that's not the goal, though
May 06 11:36:04 <Books>	the people in charge of the toys are not the same people in charge of the show
May 06 11:36:17 <Books>	the show animators decided to make them look a certain way, the toy makers don't have to give a shit
May 06 11:36:27 <Books>	they're making enough money to not have to give a shit
May 06 11:36:31 <Books>	people are still buying them
May 06 11:36:45 <Books>	i don't really see this as a problem, this is how the companies work
May 06 11:36:55 <Books>	i think it's stupid to expect anything else from them
May 06 11:37:18 <Augie>	heh
May 06 11:37:25 <Augie>	the hasbro beyblade sucks dick
May 06 11:37:38 <Augie>	compared to the tomy(japan) version
May 06 11:37:48 <Augie>	which is way better
May 06 11:37:51 <Books>	>beyblade
May 06 11:38:12 <Augie>	inb4 i was 10 when i played with the metal fight beyblades
May 06 11:38:17 <Books>	everyone who has ever spuna  beyblade has sucked at least one dick in their life, or will in their lifetime
May 06 11:38:32 <Books>	fact.
May 06 11:38:47 <Augie>	books: in life everybody had suck a dick once
May 06 11:39:05 <Augie>	irl and a termology to anarchist
May 06 11:39:43 <Books>	i haven't sucked a dick

May 06 11:46:50 <Augie>	then everybodies life is boring and stupid
May 06 11:47:07 <Books>	which is why most people don't talk about the boring parts of their lives all the time
May 06 11:47:19 <Books>	only a fraction of your life is going to be worth talking about
May 06 11:47:30 <Augie>	this is mostly the first time i talk about my boring part of my life

May 07 00:34:03 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Wow. I just killed the first real boss in Metal Gear Rising in a really vicious way. Froze her solid and then sliced her to bits. This was just after her sympathetic backstory thing about avenging her family in the algerian civil war
May 07 00:34:07 <zoobone>	theres also full penetration in the first two minutes
May 07 00:34:11 <zoobone>	and it shows it

May 07 00:34:19 <zoobone>	all the way in
May 07 00:35:01 <derram>	scandalous 
May 07 00:35:26 <zoobone>	the whole movie is pretty fucked
May 07 00:35:29 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	she's having a post death thing. Her cybernetics are keeping her just alive enough to send a radio transmission to her... I assume lover
May 07 00:35:50 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	saying she fell, that she was sorry, but she needs him to be strong for her
May 07 00:35:57 <zoobone>	I think the PIV balls slapping against pussy sets a good tone for the rest of the movie
May 07 00:36:03 <zoobone>	ts pretty grotesque
May 07 00:36:03 <derram>	is she still in the frozen chunks? 
May 07 00:36:28 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Her body's dead. its her cybernetics sending the message.
May 07 00:37:13 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	the whole time I was standing over her corpse.
May 07 00:37:37 <Zeal_s>	Is her corpse the frozen chunks
May 07 00:37:48 <derram>	sounds like. a metal gear game 
May 07 00:37:58 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Well it is sooo
May 07 00:38:33 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	and sort of zeal. It's not like I shattered her; I sliced her to bits. So I'm standing over frozen severed arms legs head whatnot
May 07 00:38:44 <Zeal_s>	ah :V
May 07 00:39:10 <derram>	yeah, that's what I was curious about

May 07 05:39:09 <Smooze>	honestly that's probably not your problem
May 07 05:39:30 <Smooze>	I'd bet it's a combination of crosshair placement, reaction time, and lack of game sense

May 07 05:42:52 <Smooze>	get used to playing with one sensitivity
May 07 05:43:17 <Smooze>	moving your mouse all the way across your mousepad should be about 180 degrees
May 07 05:43:34 <Smooze>	if you play your angles right you should never have to turn more than that on a dime
May 07 05:44:28 <Augie>	though 400 feel sluggish to me but made my aim better
May 07 05:44:58 <Augie>	because i got the habit to keep my crosshair at head level
May 07 05:45:09 <Smooze>	good

May 07 07:16:19 <Breaklets>	Wooo
May 07 07:16:29 <Langly>	I once had a Sony Viao PCG-C1 Pentium 233MHZ laptop with an 8" wide screen with a PCMCIA wifi card and large antennas grafted onto the screen and a second USB Ethernet adapter serving as a wifi bridge
May 07 07:16:56 <Langly>	then into that I had a Fujitsu Point 1600 Pentium 166MHz tablet working as a WiFi bridge but then
May 07 07:17:10 <Langly>	allowing a serial PDA to access the internet via an IRDA link
May 07 07:17:47 <Langly>	So it was IRDA to the point 1600 over crossover cable to the viao in a room that was normally out of wifi range but my hackjob of a wifi system could get on
May 07 07:18:12 <Langly>	And managed to get the PDA loading pages
May 07 07:19:05 <Langly>	http://imgur.com/a/QHroh
May 07 07:20:23 <Langly>	PCMCIA card was pulled from a dead router
May 07 07:20:57 <Langly>	I had to mash together the drivers and utilities from 3 manufactures to get the system to recognize and use the WiFi card
May 07 07:21:23 <Langly>	found a working driver, but the wifi connection utility kept claiming wrong card, so I had to do some trickery

May 07 08:39:53 <derram>	oh yeah, and books
May 07 08:39:58 <derram>	did you watch that review?
May 07 08:40:09 <derram>	there's like 4 parts
May 07 08:40:34 <wolfieshy>	you could get into drug dealing 
May 07 08:41:27 <derram>	don't have the balls to sell drugs :I
May 07 08:41:54 <Foodplin>	4 pots please
May 07 08:43:15 <Books>	what review
May 07 08:43:28 <Books>	i've sold drugs to friends a few times
May 07 08:43:54 <Books>	but to actually make money off of it you need to raise the prices higher. tough buisness
May 07 08:44:10 <Books>	and since i only have friends to sell to, i never sell for much more than i paid
May 07 08:44:26 <Books>	hard to make money off selling drugs unless you deal in larger numbers
May 07 08:45:30 <wolfieshy>	growing your own plants and selling to a few friends is probably profitable since you just get the seeds back from the plants indefinitely I'd assume
May 07 08:45:43 <derram>	I don't buy in large enough quantities to sell 
May 07 08:45:58 <derram>	only lasts long enough for me to make it to payday
May 07 08:46:05 <Books>	yeah, then you have to buy the supplies to grow
May 07 08:46:07 <Books>	and the space
May 07 08:46:12 <Books>	and the legal risk goes way up
May 07 08:46:25 <wolfieshy>	a basement and some plant growing lights?
May 07 08:46:36 <Books>	and time, effort, upkeep
May 07 08:46:39 <Books>	not everyone has a basement
May 07 08:46:40 <wolfieshy>	not everyone has a basement though

May 07 08:47:33 <Books>	no
May 07 08:47:39 <Books>	hey, i lovew all star-batman and robin
May 07 08:47:45 <derram>	hehe
May 07 08:47:54 <wolfieshy>	but we shouldn't judge you for it; can't judge a books by its cover
May 07 08:47:56 <derram>	you'll hate the review
May 07 08:48:08 <Books>	prolly
May 07 08:48:21 <Books>	too many people hate All Star Batman
May 07 08:48:43 <derram>	he raises some good points about the problems
May 07 08:48:47 <wolfieshy>	I bet books has the spine to sell drugs
May 07 08:48:52 <Books>	none, since it's an elseworld?
May 07 08:49:02 <wolfieshy>	if books got a tatoo would that mean he had ink 
May 07 08:49:09 <Books>	i do have a tattoo
May 07 08:49:25 <wolfieshy>	books held up two charts; he had a pair-o-graphs
May 07 08:49:34 <Books>	I don't like Frank Miller all that much
May 07 08:49:37 <Books>	but i love this story
May 07 08:49:54 <wolfieshy>	at night he doesn't need a blanket, he already has covers 
May 07 08:50:17 <wolfieshy>	doesn't need a diet either, already paper thin
May 07 08:50:27 <Books>	it's the darkest take on Batman, takes away every good quality batman has, and gives him no good reason
May 07 08:50:43 <Books>	but it's an elseworld
May 07 08:50:52 <Books>	meaning it cat, and should, be a new take on Batman
May 07 08:50:57 <Books>	can
May 07 08:51:05 <Books>	fuck me i can't type normal words anymore
May 07 08:51:13 <derram>	yeah, he didin't like how batman behaved 
May 07 08:51:19 <Books>	but
May 07 08:51:21 <Books>	elseworld
May 07 08:51:25 <Books>	fucking
May 07 08:51:28 <derram>	calls him "Crazy Steve"
May 07 08:51:42 <Books>	it's literally the perfect place for that kind of take on batman
May 07 08:51:51 <Books>	if it should exist anywhere, it would be there
May 07 08:52:17 <derram>	I didn't know it was an alternate dimension 
May 07 08:52:31 <Books>	that's what "all star" means
May 07 08:52:34 <Books>	he says inth e begining
May 07 08:53:03 <Books>	it's DC's project to rival Marvel's "what if" brand of titles
May 07 08:53:24 <Books>	it's supposed to be a seperate dimension, a different take
May 07 08:53:48 <derram>	yeah, I really had no idea 
May 07 08:53:57 <derram>	even back when I read the books :I
May 07 08:54:47 <Books>	it's supposed to be a disgusting, sexist universe. the dialouge can be blunt, but it's supposed to be a reflection on that Gotham
May 07 08:54:53 <Books>	this guy is bothered by stupid shit.
May 07 08:55:21 <derram>	maybe he missed the premise
May 07 08:55:37 <Books>	maybe he's a judgmental asshole who makes money by being a judgmental asshole?
May 07 08:55:42 <derram>	but that just means he's right about it not being batman
May 07 08:55:51 <Books>	it's not meant to be batman
May 07 08:56:03 <derram>	right, "Goddamn Batman"
May 07 08:56:07 <derram>	:3
May 07 08:56:16 <Books>	calling Dick a retard, hitting him when he starts to cry
May 07 08:56:35 <Books>	mentally tortures him and nearly makes him starve to death
May 07 08:56:37 <Foodplin>	http://i.imgur.com/4jC6wf1.png
May 07 08:56:42 <Books>	laughing while he kicks cops in the face
May 07 08:56:46 <Books>	it's great.
May 07 08:56:52 <Books>	but it's clearly not meant to be robin
May 07 08:56:57 <Books>	batman*
May 07 08:57:15 <Books>	that was the purpose from start to finish.
May 07 08:57:31 <Books>	Dick's dialoge make it clear that Batman is not being a good guy
May 07 08:57:47 <Books>	what's funny is, Frank Miller claimed this story takes place in the same universe as The Dark Knight Rises
May 07 08:58:40 <Books>	meaning the badass old, retired Batman from the comic and movies everyone knows is the same that kidnapped Dick and told him he was drafted into war
May 07 08:59:24 <derram>	yeah, Linkara mentioned that 
May 07 08:59:53 <derram>	which is why he was pissed about the characterization 
May 07 09:00:02 <derram>	Crazy Steve, the hobo who found the batsuit
May 07 09:00:10 <Books>	how can you be angry at the characterization of a character ina  stand alone story
May 07 09:00:16 <Books>	then you jsut don't like the character
May 07 09:00:32 <derram>	>Frank Miller claimed this story takes place in the same universe as The Dark Knight Rises
May 07 09:00:37 <Books>	it's fine not to like this kind of take on Batman, but it's not bad because of that
May 07 09:00:46 <Books>	stand alone universe, whatever.
May 07 09:01:03 <Books>	it has three stories in the universe, total. two of them with a retired version of the character
May 07 09:01:59 <Books>	so a different version of the character
May 07 09:03:25 <Books>	i love Batman, he's my favorite super hero. But i love this series. people gotta get that it's elseworld
May 07 09:03:34 <Books>	haha, the orignal script from Frank
May 07 09:03:40 <Books>	that's pretty funny to read
May 07 09:03:41 <derram>	hehe
May 07 09:04:11 <Books>	He's an asshole, but i like his stories
May 07 09:04:53 <derram>	well, Linkara does a lot of comic book reviews 
May 07 09:05:07 <derram>	apparently does a lot of reviews of really bad comics
May 07 09:05:27 <derram>	he also did the History of the Power Rangers series I was watching
May 07 09:06:09 <Books>	i mean, he's paid to be a judgmental asshole, of course he's going to be a judgmental asshole about stories for his show
May 07 09:07:01 <derram>	I don't think he gets paid all that well :I
May 07 09:07:11 <Books>	heh, the voiceovering is funny though
May 07 09:07:25 <derram>	he just uploaded a video a few days ago, he's still using a really shitty camera
May 07 09:10:10 <Books>	he's comparing this batman to the main universe batman too much.
May 07 09:11:55 <Books>	it's just an invlaid argument against the story
May 07 09:13:07 <derram>	well, I think he mentions something about it not being billed as an alternate universe 
May 07 09:13:24 <Books>	exactly
May 07 09:13:37 <Books>	exactly why "this batman isn't acting like batman" isn't a valid argument
May 07 09:13:54 <Books>	it's not supposed to be acting like batman
May 07 09:14:18 <derram>	then why make him batman :I
May 07 09:14:33 <Books>	Why make any elseworld with an existing character?
May 07 09:14:45 <Books>	Why make Dark Knight Returns?
May 07 09:15:06 <Books>	It's a different take on the characters, anda different take on Robin's origin
May 07 09:15:50 <Books>	a different Gotham. elseworlds make up so much of all the the most popular comic book stories, they sell
May 07 09:16:15 <Books>	people like different takes on existing worlds, DC does it all the time.
May 07 09:16:33 <Books>	Marvel too
May 07 09:17:57 <Books>	it makes sense that Frank Miller would be put in charge of a batman elseworld, and this is his general writing style taken to it's most extreme. It was an expirement, and everyone thought it had the chance to sell well
May 07 09:18:30 <Books>	and it also didn't, it got cancelled before it could finish
May 07 09:18:44 <Books>	people only put up with 10 issues anyway
May 07 09:18:54 <derram>	apparently that took 4 years 
May 07 09:19:04 <derram>	huge delays 
May 07 09:19:54 <derram>	Linkara mentions all the 2 page spreads a few times
May 07 09:21:30 <Books>	I think that was just the last few issues. did he say 14 issues or ten?
May 07 09:21:48 <Books>	I've only read ten, i thought that's all that were out, adn the story never finished
May 07 09:22:07 <derram>	10 
May 07 09:22:28 <Books>	eh, i dunno though.
May 07 09:23:24 <derram>	there was a year long break between a couple of the reviews because the book too so  long to come out
May 07 09:24:38 <Books>	huh

May 07 17:57:41 <Books>	thus, to me, flawless
May 07 17:57:46 <Books>	thus perfect
May 07 17:57:48 <zooman>	i recall noticing a few plotholes
May 07 17:57:56 <Books>	i recall not caring about them
May 07 17:58:01 <zooman>	Small,but nontheless there
May 07 17:58:13 <zooman>	The movie was well shot and good all around
May 07 17:58:18 <zooman>	But it had quite a few goofs
May 07 17:58:21 <Books>	i don't care about minor plotholes, didn't damage the movie for me
May 07 17:58:49 <Saltbearer>	http://www.residentadvisor.net/review-view.aspx?id=10716 this review is still painfully pretentious
May 07 17:58:58 <zooman>	they didnt ruin the movie in the least
May 07 17:59:07 <zooman>	But "perfect" means flawless, and it had a few flaws
May 07 17:59:14 <Books>	no flaws in my eyes.
May 07 17:59:32 <zooman>	Smal flaws to be sure, but just because you loved it doesnt erase the flaws
May 07 17:59:39 <Books>	flaws like what
May 07 18:00:03 <zooman>	I would have to rewatch the movie to remember them
May 07 18:00:43 <Books>	i've watched it twice, if there was anything that bothered me, i got over it
May 07 18:01:42 <Books>	there's a handful of movies i consider "perfect," so it's not like it's a really high standard for me anyway
May 07 18:02:12 <Books>	Fight Club, Mr. Nobody, Donnie Darko, The Dark Knight
May 07 18:02:20 <zooman>	Well, what you consider perfect and what is perfect are two different things
May 07 18:02:36 <Books>	well, literally perfect isn't a standard you can really apply to movies
May 07 18:02:40 <Augie>	zooman nothing is perfect
May 07 18:02:40 <Books>	it being an artform
May 07 18:02:49 <Books>	you can't make a perfect piece of art
May 07 18:03:24 <zooman>	It absolutly is
May 07 18:03:42 <Books>	but
May 07 18:03:47 <Books>	it's a form of art
May 07 18:03:55 <zooman>	You can make a movie with no flaws in shooting and continuity
May 07 18:04:13 <zooman>	No small little set errors
May 07 18:04:15 <Books>	continuinity errors are not always flaws
May 07 18:04:15 <zooman>	ect
May 07 18:04:33 <zooman>	Usually they are
May 07 18:04:39 <Books>	at least, not in my eyes. some things aren't important enough for the movie to spend time to explain
May 07 18:04:56 <zooman>	But it should at least be done with and wrapped up if thats the case
May 07 18:05:04 <Books>	it doesn't make it flawed that it doesn't explain everything and leaves people confused
May 07 18:05:11 <zooman>	Just because something isnt very important doesnt mean the movie is allowed to leave a gaping plothole
May 07 18:05:18 <zooman>	thats not what im saying, but okay
May 07 18:05:27 <Books>	it's all different kinds of storytelling
May 07 18:05:31 <zooman>	sounds like you think dredd is the smartest movie ever made, haha
May 07 18:05:46 <Books>	i said i had a handful of movies on this list
May 07 18:05:59 <Books>	it's not smart, it's an action movie, but a great action movie
May 07 18:06:23 <zooman>	^
May 07 18:06:27 <zooman>	I agree with that
May 07 18:06:28 <Books>	it's a perfect excetution of what i want an action movie to be
May 07 18:06:32 <zooman>	Wholeheartedly
May 07 18:06:38 <zooman>	It was  damn good action movie
May 07 18:06:50 <wolfieshy>	I don't think I'd really be interested in an action movie without a good plot
May 07 18:07:03 <Books>	Fighting Crime isn't enough of a plot for you?
May 07 18:07:10 <Books>	that didn't need to be capitalized.
May 07 18:07:12 <zooman>	dredd doesnt need an amazing plot, because its simple lot is enough to propel the action and keep it interesting
May 07 18:07:15 <jeep8790>	50 years in the isocube creep

May 07 18:12:48 <zooman>	when characters spout exposition at the camera

They have released their first song, entitled "4AM".[11] Flea has since come out and said that Antemasque is a project between  Omar and Cedric, and that he is only a contributing artist as op

May 07 22:32:45 <Supersaw_Hoover>	the only Antemasque song I actually like so far is Drown All Your Witches
May 07 22:32:45 <bilb>	This is the first I've heard of them
May 07 22:32:55 <bilb>	But yeah
May 07 22:33:04 <bilb>	It sound good so far
May 07 22:33:22 <bilb>	...it
May 07 22:33:27 <bilb>	's not TMV, but still good
May 07 22:33:50 <Supersaw_Hoover>	I dunno right now I'd rather read Cedric's twitter

May 07 22:36:20 <Supersaw_Hoover>	listening to the 34 minute track "Bring The Sun / Toussaint d'Ouverture"
May 07 22:36:22 <bilb>	A lot of TMV fans like to say things like "Omar IS the band" but I was always drawn to cedric's voice and lyrics just as much as omar's guitar
May 07 22:36:24 <Supersaw_Hoover>	it's got horse samples
May 07 22:36:29 <Supersaw_Hoover>	I like both tbh
May 07 22:36:45 <bilb>	right, exactly
May 07 22:36:51 <Supersaw_Hoover>	I love omar's weird atonal guitar solos
May 07 22:37:09 <Supersaw_Hoover>	I kind of emulate those and cedric's style of vocal in my music as of late and I"m not even ashamed for doing it
May 07 22:37:27 <Supersaw_Hoover>	I feel like it just works really well and there should be more music like that
May 07 22:37:28 <bilb>	Haha, I can't hit all those notes
May 07 22:37:34 <bilb>	The guy is a siren
May 07 22:37:36 <Supersaw_Hoover>	I've been getting better at it
May 07 22:37:41 <Supersaw_Hoover>	not as good as him though
May 07 22:38:04 <Supersaw_Hoover>	I make my music in a way such that if I'm offkey it sounds like it's on purpose

May 07 23:02:24 <wolfieshy>	the lack of a satisfactory answer makes me want to make a visit to a satis factory and buy one

May 07 23:11:31 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	How difficult is it to learn to use MySQL?
May 07 23:11:49 <bilb>	depends
May 07 23:11:51 <AttackTheMoon>	terra, snape kills ryukko
May 07 23:11:59 <bilb>	Do you have any knowledge of relation databases?
May 07 23:11:59 <terra>	ok
May 07 23:12:03 <kwulhu>	poni
May 07 23:12:19 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	I do not.
May 07 23:12:24 <bilb>	SQL isn't rocket science, but it also isn't intuitive
May 07 23:12:39 <bilb>	If you want to learn it, try to learn about relation databases first
May 07 23:12:48 <bilb>	Just how they work and whatnot
May 07 23:13:01 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	It'd be for a website.  Forums, basically.
May 07 23:13:02 <bilb>	That will make querying and modiufying them with SQL a lot easier
May 07 23:13:26 <bilb>	Are you using a pre-built solution or making your own?
May 07 23:13:37 <bilb>	If the former, don't worry TOO much about it
May 07 23:13:38 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Probably the former.
May 07 23:13:58 <bilb>	Just as you gain more and more data, you'll need to know how to backup and restore it
May 07 23:14:09 <bilb>	And if you're curious about it, how to query it
May 07 23:14:12 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	I've already got backups and restoring down.
May 07 23:14:26 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	the site hoster makes that pretty easy, from what I can tell.
May 07 23:14:33 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	*server host
May 07 23:15:13 <bilb>	Just be sure to make very regular backups if you're not comfortable enough with SQL to fix any problems manually 
May 07 23:15:18 <bilb>	They should be rare though
May 07 23:16:55 <kwulhu>	poni
May 07 23:17:01 <kwulhu>	I want to hug a pony sexually
May 07 23:17:09 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	the site's going to be http://theangrybadger.com  The server host lets us attach one domain to the server for free, alongside all the other shit we're doing with it.
May 07 23:17:13 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Which is basically a Gmod server
May 07 23:17:18 <bilb>	sexual poni hugs can be stored in a relational database
May 07 23:17:31 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	The guy who owns all of this still needs to register the domain.
May 07 23:18:03 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Know of any good domain registration sites that aren't Godaddy?
May 07 23:18:09 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	I found domain.com
May 07 23:18:18 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	which will let us have it for $10 for the year.

May 07 23:55:56 <wolfieshy>	pokemon had an overarching purpose
May 07 23:56:19 <terra>	true but that was slow moving and could make sense without watching the last few episodes
May 07 23:56:33 <terra>	mainly because they repeat everything a total of 10 times every episode about what they need to do now
May 07 23:56:34 <wolfieshy>	sometimes it made less sense if you did

May 08 01:33:33 <DrinkiePie>	On April 11, 1983, after Metallica had driven to New York to record their debut album, Mustaine was officially fired from the band because of his alcoholism, drug abuse, overly aggressive behavior, and personality clashes with founding members Hetfield and Ulrich, an incident Mustaine refers to as "no warning, no second chance". The band packed up Dave's gear, drove him to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, and put him on a Greyhound bus bound for 
May 08 01:33:34 <DrinkiePie>	Los Angeles.[6] It was on this bus ride that Mustaine scribbled some lyrical ideas on the back of a hand bill, which would later become the song "Set the World Afire" from the 1988 Megadeth album So Far, So Good... So What!

May 08 04:39:25 <Carlos>	o ok
May 08 04:39:46 <Carlos>	also, I've been told they hate tourists so even being able to hold a basic conversation is a help

May 08 06:30:30 <derram>	if you've been playing a whole lot of could be the build up for the finale 
May 08 06:30:35 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	It says I have 12 hours total in the game, but I'm sure a lot of that is idling
May 08 06:31:16 <derram>	yeah, that steam count is really flawed 
May 08 06:31:38 <derram>	counts from the moment you launch the game 
May 08 06:32:22 <Esplin>	yes
May 08 06:32:35 <Esplin>	80 percent of my BoI time is the game just sitting there
May 08 06:34:52 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I have so many upgrades so I think I'm at the minimum halfway through the game. At the same time, it's a long ass game
May 08 06:35:25 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Or maybe I just suck and fights that should be 4 minutes are like 10
May 08 06:39:13 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	if I could make one change to this game, I'd either make Shurikans not terrible, or I'd replace Shurikans with the pistol
May 08 06:40:52 <derram>	so I he pistol is an upgrade to I the 
May 08 06:40:59 <derram>	shuriken
May 08 06:41:18 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	the way Shurikans in shadow warrior work is that if you have the katana equipped, pressing q will launch a shurikan. If you have a gun equipped, q makes you do a quick slash with your katana.
May 08 06:41:24 <derram>	or can you carry both 
May 08 06:41:38 <derram>	huh, weird 
May 08 06:41:43 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	these are both useless.
May 08 06:42:12 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	it'd be better if q with a sword equpped would be a quick offhanded pistol shot, and with the gun equiped, a BETTER sword attack.
May 08 06:42:32 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	because quite frankly I don't think I've caused any damaged with the quickslash attack. At any point.
May 08 06:44:44 <derram>	always hated melee in fps games 
May 08 06:45:01 <derram>	never works right 
May 08 06:45:38 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	well, the swordplay in this game is good and very satisfying.
May 08 06:45:55 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	but the quickslash doesn't really do anything
May 08 06:49:02 <Esplin>	http://www.hasbro.com/equestria-girls/en_US/play/become-equestria-girl.cfm
May 08 06:51:08 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Oh shit, sprinting and click q does a kick
May 08 06:51:33 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	that'd have been useful hours ago
May 08 07:00:14 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Hm, I killed 249 enemies in this level. That's a bit irritating, one more would have given me a nice 250
May 08 07:02:01 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	yes, snow level over, now I have a better framerate.
May 08 07:03:18 <derram>	haha, finally found something that stresses your laotop
May 08 07:03:46 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	shadows stress my laptop. Usually if I turn shadows to minimum I can run stuff no problem
May 08 07:05:22 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	even then, derram, the snow made me drop from a clear 60ish to a less nice but still very playable 40ish
May 08 07:05:33 <derram>	hehe

May 08 07:07:00 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	wow. after several levels of fighting crazy ass demons I'm back to fighting human yakuza members.
May 08 07:07:27 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Although this time they're demonically possessed yakuza members, they're still going down kinda easy
May 08 07:07:32 <derram>	are you sure that wasn't some kinda special challenge mission? 
May 08 07:08:47 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Nope. This is story mode, after all
May 08 07:09:21 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Also, I just killed a katana wielding yakuza mook by slicing off his hands. He just kinda stood there for a second before I lopped his head off
May 08 07:10:37 <derram>	hehe
May 08 07:11:06 <derram>	you really should have the option to just leave them alive after cutting off both arms 
May 08 07:12:34 <derram>	haha, it's raining! 
May 08 07:12:52 <derram>	but not hard enough for my liking 
May 08 07:13:05 <derram>	and it stopped ;-;
May 08 07:13:50 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I do, I just didn't
May 08 07:14:12 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	it's not kill animation, derram, my attack just happened to lop off his hands. After a moment I decided to take his head off
May 08 07:14:37 <derram>	huh, that's pretty neat r
May 08 07:14:47 <derram>	never heard that game could do that 
May 08 07:15:24 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Metal Gear Rising does that. ou can pick your slice locations to chop enemies up however you deem fit.
May 08 07:15:37 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	and Shadow Warrior has some great dismemberment
May 08 07:16:01 <derram>	yeah, I remember the watermelon slicing demo 
May 08 07:16:16 <derram>	but I go-to metal gear for the sneaking 
May 08 07:17:06 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	True, but MGR is still a top notch hacknslash

May 08 09:43:27 <Books>	it's the dawn of a new age in television, derram
May 08 09:43:42 <Books>	this show is spearheading a project to launch 4 other dc tv shows
May 08 09:44:02 <Books>	and to expand on the competetition, Marvel is releasing 5-6 tv shows in the next for years
May 08 09:44:28 <Books>	comic book live action tv shows are going to make up a huge amount of tv shows on ait
May 08 09:44:41 <Books>	especially if they get more popular, go to other channles, and shit
May 08 09:45:19 <Books>	like how it seems half of successful movies right now are super hero movies?
May 08 09:45:21 <derram>	they've been trying for a long time
May 08 09:45:23 <Books>	just going to get worse
May 08 09:45:34 <Books>	we're in a golden age a live action super heroes, derram
May 08 09:45:41 <Books>	in movies and in tv
May 08 09:46:04 <Sprinkles>	God the avengers gave me the biggest nerd boner
May 08 09:46:21 <Books>	best super hero movie made, easily.
May 08 09:46:25 <Books>	i love that movie
May 08 09:46:33 <Books>	i love all of Marvel's latest movies
May 08 09:46:36 <Books>	the whole project
May 08 09:46:51 <Books>	and now i'm getting stoked for all these new tv shows
May 08 09:47:27 <scriptea>	Books, are you watching Shield as well?
May 08 09:47:28 <Books>	seriesly, give it three years, super heroes will be nearly half of all successful movies and shows.
May 08 09:47:34 <Books>	every episode.
May 08 09:47:37 <scriptea>	hah
May 08 09:48:35 <Books>	Between Marvel studious, spider man, whoever has the x-men movies, and all this dc stuff, it's a massive amount of media.
May 08 09:48:47 <Sprinkles>	What'd you think about the nolaverse movies books?
May 08 09:48:57 <Books>	i don't think there has ever been so many tv shows currently airing in the same universe
May 08 09:49:01 <Books>	movies books?
May 08 09:49:12 <Sprinkles>	...Your name is fucking books, shitlord
May 08 09:49:14 <scriptea>	heh
May 08 09:49:31 <Books>	the comics they made in the universe of nolan's movies?
May 08 09:49:35 <Books>	I never read them.
May 08 09:49:46 <Books>	didn't hear anything that great about them
May 08 09:49:50 <Books>	i have a lot of comics to read.
May 08 09:50:23 <Sprinkles>	I hate  you
May 08 09:50:27 <Sprinkles>	You're tacky and I hate you
May 08 09:50:31 <Books>	:(
May 08 09:50:48 <scriptea>	I think Books is a bigger comic nerd than I am an anime nerd.
May 08 09:51:01 <Books>	i dunno. maybe.
May 08 09:51:04 <Books>	i am a huge comic nerd.
May 08 09:52:30 <Books>	once the lat issue of Forver Evil is released i'll have a file that holds every issue of every new 52 series up until the end of it's first universe-wide story
May 08 09:52:48 <Books>	years of ongoings. I should upload it somewhere.
May 08 09:52:49 <derram>	wow
May 08 09:53:13 <derram>	you'll also have to make a reading list so people know what order to read them in
May 08 09:53:28 <Books>	there are websites for that.
May 08 09:54:02 <Books>	besides, it's not as complicated as most people think it is
May 08 09:54:30 <Books>	the vast majority of comic book arks that have come out in the new 52 don't require you to read anything before it
May 08 09:54:38 <Books>	it's mostly stand-alone stories
May 08 09:54:44 <Books>	really easy to read and get into
May 08 09:54:44 <derram>	that's only because you understand the basic naming conventions
May 08 09:54:46 <Books>	but people don't know
May 08 09:54:53 <Books>	what do you mean
May 08 09:54:54 <Books>	?
May 08 09:55:38 <derram>	the complicated bit
May 08 09:55:53 <Books>	like, for when they do cross-overs?
May 08 09:56:20 <Books>	they tell you what issue the story takes place next in the comic.
May 08 09:56:53 <Books>	people over-complicate comics too much
May 08 09:57:03 <Sprinkles>	GUYS
May 08 09:57:04 <derram>	hehe
May 08 09:57:06 <Sprinkles>	KILLING FLOOR 2
May 08 09:57:13 <derram>	the stories do jump around a lot
May 08 09:57:20 <Books>	they make it pretty simple most of the time
May 08 09:57:30 <derram>	Sparks, I never got into the first one
May 08 09:57:33 <Books>	most arks can be read stand-alone. the vast, vast majority.
May 08 09:57:34 <derram>	too much bullet time
May 08 09:57:45 <Books>	what do you mean jump around?
May 08 09:58:10 <derram>	http://i.imgur.com/K0lxVfj.jpg
May 08 09:58:47 <Books>	yeah, that was their most complicated story yet
May 08 09:58:56 <Books>	since it was the beginging to thie rmain event, Forever Evil
May 08 09:59:15 <Books>	it went, in order, through three ongoings, and had a couplke irrelevent tie-ins
May 08 10:00:03 <Books>	you're not supposed to pick up the tie-ins unless you have a huge interest in the story or the comic it takes place in
May 08 10:00:08 <Books>	doesn't need to be read at all.
May 08 10:00:46 <Books>	otherwise it went JL > JLA > JLD > JL >JLA >JLD
May 08 10:01:07 <Books>	and at the end of every issue they tell you what issue happens next
May 08 10:02:12 <Books>	it was as simple as they could make it
May 08 10:02:25 <Books>	if it was all in one ongoing, it would take months longer for the whole story to be released
May 08 10:03:14 <Esplin>	Marvel Civil War did that  beautifully
May 08 10:03:23 <Books>	you could argue that the tie-ins were so needless that they did nothing but complicate the story, and make it seem bigger to new readers, but as long as you know what a tie-in is you're fine
May 08 10:04:16 <Books>	never read it
May 08 10:04:35 <Books>	how'd they do it? didn't most super heroes get involved in it in their own ongoings?
May 08 10:05:13 <Books>	kind of, you know, universe-wide story

May 08 10:06:46 <Books>	funny that they un-did Peter's coming out
May 08 10:06:54 <Books>	only to have most peolpe re-learn his identity later
May 08 10:07:20 <Esplin>	I did not like that bit
May 08 10:07:23 <Esplin>	it felt cheap
May 08 10:07:36 <Books>	it was.
May 08 10:07:40 <Esplin>	http://i.imgur.com/79pgwDd.png
May 08 10:07:54 <Books>	but i really like Superoir Spider-Man
May 08 10:07:56 <Books>	you read it?
May 08 10:08:09 <Books>	it mentions some of his history
May 08 10:08:09 <Esplin>	I have not
May 08 10:08:14 <Books>	it just ended
May 08 10:08:19 <Esplin>	I am still trying to catch up on ultimate

May 08 10:08:21 <Books>	super short
May 08 10:08:36 <Books>	easy read
May 08 10:08:39 <Books>	fun character
May 08 10:08:49 <Esplin>	Spider Man was never one of my favorites
May 08 10:08:57 <Esplin>	I was more of a Deadpool and X-men fan
May 08 10:08:58 <Books>	you know the plot to Superoir?
May 08 10:09:03 <Esplin>	I will look it up
May 08 10:09:08 <Books>	It's not Peter
May 08 10:09:13 <Esplin>	Who is it?
May 08 10:09:19 <Books>	Doc Ock switches brains with 
May 08 10:09:20 <Books>	Peter
May 08 10:09:30 <Esplin>	huh
May 08 10:09:31 <Esplin>	neat
May 08 10:09:34 <Books>	lets peter die, becomes Spider-Man in the new body
May 08 10:09:51 <Books>	he's a dick. A major sub-plot is how all the other super heroes think he's going crazy.
May 08 10:10:05 <Esplin>	What universe is it in?
May 08 10:10:11 <Books>	main universe.
May 08 10:10:24 <Books>	616, yo.
May 08 10:10:28 <Books>	this is legit.
May 08 10:11:00 <Esplin>	not bad
May 08 10:11:00 <Books>	Peter died and Doc Ock was Spider -Man. Made a spider-island and got henchman.
May 08 10:11:16 <Books>	finished college, made a company, does crazy science shit
May 08 10:11:21 <Books>	it's really fantastic.
May 08 10:11:44 <Books>	wish it lsted longer
May 08 10:12:04 <Esplin>	time to find a torrent of issue 1
May 08 10:12:08 <Esplin>	and see if it is worth it
May 08 10:12:08 <Books>	but it looks like it will leave some long-term scars on Spider man
May 08 10:12:13 <Books>	you can prolyl find a torrent of the whole thing
May 08 10:12:14 <Books>	it's over.
May 08 10:12:31 <derram>	how many times is he gonna get dumped back in school :I
May 08 10:12:43 <Books>	he's out of school
May 08 10:12:45 <Books>	he finished.
May 08 10:12:47 <Books>	got a degree.
May 08 10:13:07 <Books>	it wasn't a major sub plot either. didn't take him long.
May 08 10:13:23 <Books>	the art's really good too
May 08 10:13:33 <Esplin>	I HOPE GWEN SNAPS HER NECK AGAAAAAAAAAAIN

May 08 10:13:54 <Esplin>	I just never liked heer
May 08 10:14:10 <Books>	it's funny to see Doc Ock pretend to be Peter.
May 08 10:14:18 <Books>	since he's in his body
May 08 10:15:05 <Books>	I really liked it, even though i never really read a new spider man comic. Never kept up with him that much
May 08 10:15:20 <Books>	it was a good combination to attract new readers and keep old fans interested
May 08 10:15:27 <Books>	well, mostly the old fans hated it for not being peter
May 08 10:15:35 <Books>	but it was interesting
May 08 10:16:56 <Esplin>	http://i.imgur.com/kYVhZvS.jpg

May 08 10:18:57 <Books>	i thought they relaucnhed it a few years ago
May 08 10:19:06 <Books>	Marvel did a soft relaunch
May 08 10:19:12 <Books>	to compete with DC's new 52
May 08 10:19:36 <Books>	but they kept the universe, just started with lower numbers and kept things simple

May 08 14:53:20 <terra>	my friend runs cs at 130fps with that

May 08 14:54:44 <Augie>	nice terra

I then proceed to keep them in a small shoebox under my bed.

May 09 01:42:31 <Carlos>	his playstyle is like "sacrifice yourself for the good of the team and bamboozle the enemy attempts to fuck you over"
May 09 01:42:38 <Carlos>	he deals AP I think
May 09 01:42:43 <zoomin>	I DONTCARE
May 09 01:42:45 <Carlos>	and his basic attack is melee

May 09 01:49:07 <zoomin>	Its not like dota where any hero can jungle if theyre smart
May 09 01:49:11 <Carlos>	concussive blows on the blue and red buffs would make it easy to take them down
May 09 01:49:20 <Carlos>	like how every third attack Vi does armor piercing
May 09 01:49:29 <zoomin>	Youve gotta stick to the meta that riot forces

May 09 01:49:42 <Carlos>	it's more fun that way
May 09 01:49:56 <RisenLM>	But you're at a disadvantage
May 09 01:50:04 <Carlos>	sometimes, you've gotta adhere, but otherwise I freeball it in terms of lane assignment

May 09 05:50:46 <derram>	well, that would have been a shit adaption
May 09 05:50:58 <Esplin>	it could have been like Double Dragon
May 09 05:51:03 <Esplin>	not as good as the arcade but still fun
May 09 05:51:05 <derram>	do you remember the ninja turtles arcade port?
May 09 05:51:13 <Esplin>	I liked it on NES
May 09 05:51:43 <derram>	it was a fun game, but if it didn't have the turtles no one would have played it 
May 09 05:51:51 <derram>	had a lot of issues 
May 09 05:52:10 <derram>	also lost a lot of the individual turtle stuff the arcade had
May 09 05:52:22 <derram>	the simpons game would have been way worse
May 09 05:52:41 <Esplin>	SNES might be able to handle it
May 09 05:54:00 <derram>	yeah, they did port one over to it
May 09 05:54:07 <derram>	at least I think that was an arcade 
May 09 05:54:27 <derram>	turtles in time, wasn't it

May 09 08:52:03 <derram>	wow, his last Titans review is where he gets pissed
May 09 08:52:14 <derram>	apparently DC did some pretty bad things 
May 09 08:52:27 <derram>	tossed out a bunch of a previous writer's stuff
May 09 08:52:52 <derram>	and the new editor hadn't read any of the old Titans stuffs
May 09 08:56:57 <Books>	"DC" didn't do bad things
May 09 08:57:00 <Books>	it's just writers
May 09 08:57:19 <Books>	it wasn't an executive descision, just shitty writers
May 09 08:57:21 <Books>	and shitty editors.
May 09 08:57:55 <Books>	the last review is of new 52, or just newer teen titans pre-flashpoint?

May 09 09:04:47 <derram>	well, he looks evil 
May 09 09:04:48 <Books>	hey, good pic
May 09 09:04:51 <derram>	also, red sky
May 09 09:04:55 <Books>	of the outfit
May 09 09:04:59 <Books>	the pic itself, eh.
May 09 09:05:02 <Books>	red eyes aren't normal
May 09 09:05:19 <Books>	but otherwise that's the outfit
May 09 09:05:28 <Books>	blue to read
May 09 09:05:42 <derram>	I'm not a fan only because it's too close to the Batman Beyond logo
May 09 09:06:02 <Books>	it's the same kind of logo as it used to be before the new 52
May 09 09:06:13 <derram>	plus, I'm pretty sure he wanted to get as far away from the robin costume as he could 
May 09 09:06:27 <derram>	and red is a terrible stealth color 
May 09 09:06:45 <Books>	that's the thing, his color was changed so he would look better in robin group shots.
May 09 09:06:56 <derram>	:I

May 09 09:07:23 <Books>	they're all red, man
May 09 09:07:33 <Books>	robin, red robin, red hood, nightwing
May 09 09:07:45 <Books>	it makes since for nightwing to have the same color sceme
May 09 09:07:53 <derram>	not really
May 09 09:08:01 <derram>	he kinda hated being robin at the end :I
May 09 09:08:21 <Books>	yeah, then he warmed up to batman later and had less disdain as he grew older
May 09 09:08:28 <Books>	he joined Batman, Inc.
May 09 09:08:32 <Books>	they're a team
May 09 09:09:12 <Books>	he became Nightwing and had a lot of disdain for Batman, but they both grew past that and became more like equals
May 09 09:10:53 <Books>	and as far as a design choice, it looks better, i think
May 09 09:10:59 <derram>	well
May 09 09:11:05 <Books>	being blue isn't a vital part to his character
May 09 09:11:11 <derram>	I don't think Batman did much growing
May 09 09:11:23 <derram>	Dick just kinda stopped hating him 
May 09 09:11:33 <Books>	he changed how he treats Dick Grayson
May 09 09:11:58 <Books>	and how he treats a lot of his allies better for awhile
May 09 09:12:17 <Books>	after he starts taking care of his son, and launching Batman, Inc.
May 09 09:12:31 <Books>	it was huge character growth for batman.

May 09 09:23:23 <Books>	just
May 09 09:23:28 <Books>	pushing it in the way

May 09 09:23:53 <derram>	no one noticed this?
May 09 09:23:58 <Books>	keeps himself out of the sun.
May 09 09:24:02 <Books>	everyone noticed
May 09 09:24:20 <Books>	Forever Evil is the first universe-wide event in the new 52
May 09 09:24:28 <Books>	every comic that takes place on earth mentions it
May 09 09:24:48 <Books>	the Crime Syndicate comes to earth, claims to have killed the Justice Leagues, and claims the world as their own
May 09 09:24:52 <Books>	the most public they could be.
May 09 09:25:15 <Esplin>	http://i.imgur.com/WKgb1hV.gif
May 09 09:25:52 <Books>	i've been enjoying it a lot. focues on minor heroes and villains trying to save the world since the justice league is missing
May 09 09:26:05 <Esplin>	ultraman hates the sun?
May 09 09:26:06 <Books>	the Flash's rogues are cool as shiiiit.
May 09 09:26:12 <Esplin>	does it kill his powers?
May 09 09:26:27 <Books>	being in sunlight weakens him like kryptonite weakens superman

May 09 09:27:38 <Books>	Ultraman's powers are kind of reversed from Superman's. the source of his power, anyway.
May 09 09:27:54 <Books>	the new Crime Syndicate is actually really interesting
May 09 09:28:05 <Books>	in their reverse versions of powers and characters
May 09 09:28:07 <Esplin>	yeah in the movie lex through blue kryptonite at him and it killed his powers
May 09 09:28:22 <Books>	Superman?
May 09 09:28:27 <Esplin>	no at ultraman
May 09 09:28:59 <Books>	weird.
May 09 09:29:24 <Books>	i think blue krytonite gives reg superman more powers or something

May 09 09:30:43 <Esplin>	from the superman wiki
May 09 09:30:56 <Books>	huh.
May 09 09:30:58 <Books>	kay.

May 09 09:31:27 <Books>	Bizarros are stupid.
May 09 09:31:31 <Books>	glad they revamp that character
May 09 09:31:55 <Books>	just made hima  clone of superman that didn't work, nto some extradimensional reverse dumb-talking idiot
May 09 09:32:17 <Esplin>	that reverse talking was a really stupid idea
May 09 09:33:13 <Books>	he sounds so stupid all the time.
May 09 09:33:22 <Books>	now he talks a little, and slowly, not many words
May 09 09:33:29 <Books>	but not reversed, or backwards, or wahtever
May 09 09:33:42 <Books>	i like it
May 09 09:34:05 <Books>	and he's basically Lex's pet
May 09 09:34:10 <Books>	not sure how long that will last
May 09 09:34:21 <Books>	Lex is getting in the Justice League soon
May 09 09:34:41 <Books>	i guess he can just tell him to stay home while he's busy, maybe call him for a mission when Superman isn't around.

May 09 09:40:06 <derram>	haven't watched that one yet
May 09 09:40:11 <Books>	it's first issue and ark were pretty bad, but full of action and funny enough to keep me interested, and it got way better
May 09 09:40:18 <Books>	i love the team and the characters
May 09 09:41:09 <Books>	Perfect fit for Jason Todd
May 09 09:41:17 <derram>	wait, really
May 09 09:41:18 <Books>	and i personally like the new Starfire
May 09 09:41:27 <derram>	didn't he go insane and die
May 09 09:41:28 <derram>	twice
May 09 09:41:33 <Books>	Jason Todd is the Red Hood
May 09 09:41:38 <Books>	he only died once, i'm pretty sure.
May 09 09:41:48 <Books>	in the new 52 at least
May 09 09:41:58 <Books>	killed by joker, then brought back by Talia Al Ghul
May 09 09:42:20 <Books>	trained by ninjas, now hangs with Starfire and Arsenel, Green Arrow's old sidekick
May 09 09:42:31 <Books>	two ex-sidekicks and a crazy alien.
May 09 09:42:43 <derram>	she's not crazy 
May 09 09:42:46 <derram>	just free spirited
May 09 09:42:55 <Books>	she is a little crazy now.
May 09 09:43:02 <Books>	i mean

May 09 09:43:23 <Books>	which in the DC universe is usually considered crazy
May 09 09:43:31 <Books>	she only kills bad people, though
May 09 09:44:45 <Books>	she was traded into slavery by her sister, to end a war, and she was tortured throughout her childhood until she killed her way to freedom. shit's crazy.

May 09 09:46:52 <Books>	other thant he cartoon
May 09 09:47:04 <Books>	i don't have any attachment to the old starfire

May 09 10:37:44 <derram>	they stopped showing them on tb
May 09 10:37:46 <derram>	tv*
May 09 10:37:57 <Books>	yeah, but they still gather interest for albums and artists
May 09 10:38:20 <Books>	the internet itself can be used to expose videos to a huge audience of veiwers.
May 09 10:39:42 <Books>	if a band gets a youtube page, they'll get views and subscriptions from their fans, and expose the videos to anyone looking for the same kind of music on youtube
May 09 10:40:19 <Books>	and since so many kids don't know about piracy, a shit ton of people look for music on youtube.
May 09 10:43:31 <Books>	making music videos is still efective, so people still make em. still, i wish they were more popular
May 09 10:43:50 <Books>	i look up music videos to pretty much every artist that i like
May 09 10:43:52 <scriptea>	I like how if you know how to pirate...to most people, anyways, you must know how to hack

May 09 13:17:13 <Sparkles>	That's what I'd thought you say
May 09 13:17:23 <zoomin>	Esentially the same song over and over
May 09 13:17:28 <Sparkles>	That's what I though you'd say*

May 09 13:18:57 <Sparkles>	Their guitarist is pretty good
May 09 13:19:03 <zoomin>	lol
May 09 13:19:18 <Sparkles>	Why do I even try to talk to you
May 09 13:19:32 <zoomin>	their guitarist knows how to play gutar well
May 09 13:19:41 <zoomin>	At least, at the proficiant level to be in a band
May 09 13:19:56 <zoomin>	Hes not like, above average or anything though
May 09 13:21:04 <zoomin>	Iunno, why do you talk to me?
May 09 13:21:13 <zoomin>	did you expect me to like some preteencore radio music?
May 09 13:23:24 <Sparkles>	I thought maybe you wouldn't be an elitist douchebag for once in your life. Fuck me, right?
May 09 13:23:44 <zoomin>	Not liking disturbed makes me an elitist?
May 09 13:24:01 <zoomin>	im sorry i have more discerning taste than disturbed >:I
May 09 13:24:21 <Sparkles>	You used "on the radio" as a mark of quality. That's pretty fucking douchey
May 09 13:24:49 <zoomin>	When you make music to be played on the radio is a sign of detioration of quality
May 09 13:25:01 <zoomin>	not when your music is played on the radio
May 09 13:25:08 <zoomin>	But when you make it to be played on the radio

May 09 15:00:33 <Carlos>	now he's saying galactus would kill phantom stranger
May 09 15:00:37 <Books>	the Spectre is God's personal agent of vengance, he handpicks a human to be the host of the power

May 09 15:01:05 <Books>	He has no reason to do anythin outside of that universe
May 09 15:01:16 <Books>	and Phantom Stranger gets his powers from the God in the DC universe.

May 09 15:01:25 <Books>	you just can't mix them together

May 09 15:04:09 <Books>	or something
May 09 15:04:16 <Esplin>	Galan
May 09 15:04:16 <Esplin>	Galactus is the sole survivor of the universe that existed prior to the current universe. Originally Galactus was a humanoid named Galan, who was born on the planet Taa, a paradise-like world whose civilization is said to have been the most advanced of any of the known universe of that time.[1]
May 09 15:04:16 <Esplin>	However, this universe was in its final stages of collapse. Originally, like all universes in the Multiverse, this universe had been a "Cosmic Egg" — a primal sphere of disorganized, dense, compact primordial matter. The sphere underwent a "Big Bang," an explosion that hurled the matter outwards, where much of it eventually condensed into stars and planets. This universe expanded in size for 
May 09 15:04:16 <Esplin>	billions of years, and then contracted, undergoing a "crunch" over the following billions of years. All of the matter of that universe was plunging towards a central point, where it was collapsing into a new "Cosmic Egg."
May 09 15:04:46 <Esplin>	 As the starship containing Galan and his fellow survivors approached the focal point of the Big Crunch, the heat and radiation killed all the passengers except Galan, who strangely found himself filled with new energy.[1]
May 09 15:04:48 <Esplin>	he did not kill it
May 09 15:04:52 <Esplin>	just survived it
May 09 15:05:00 <Books>	oh, that's lame

May 09 15:39:23 <Carlos>	he's a good host and his writers are good
May 09 15:39:40 <Carlos>	but I think he's going to lose some of the freedoms of being on a cable tv network
May 09 15:39:58 <Carlos>	like his show won't be so much political satire anymores
May 09 15:40:46 <Books>	i heard he's not going to do that style at all
May 09 15:41:03 <Books>	he'll be adapting to the show's style, instead of taking his own humor and character to it

May 10 02:02:43 <derram>	hmm, my guessing there's updates to the rules every once and a while 
May 10 02:03:21 <scriptea>	Not updates. Extensions.

May 10 02:14:05 <Supersaw_Hoover>	with my DM I'm expecting to play this with, he usually requires roleplaying it out
May 10 02:14:27 <Supersaw_Hoover>	I'm going to have to actually manage finances properly for this to work
May 10 02:14:41 <Supersaw_Hoover>	and do some wheeling-dealing with interest

May 10 07:00:35 <Echo>	Very rarely, new animals can spawn in already generated chunks, just like monsters do. When animals spawn in this way, they do so only on grass blocks with light level 9 or greater above them. This is also a requirement for animals spawning from monster spawners. Unlike monsters, animals do not spontaneously despawn, except for wild ocelots and wolves (which can despawn only when they are hostile).
May 10 07:01:55 <derram>	yeah,  I wouldn't depend on  that

May 10 08:57:02 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I always thought Awaken was a bit weird because I hear "take the land that is forsaken" when it's apparently "take the land that must be taken"

May 10 09:06:08 <BookserDeWitt>	he said Red Hood made a better villain than anti-hero
May 10 09:06:12 <BookserDeWitt>	which is bullshit

May 10 09:06:35 <derram>	make a post 
May 10 09:06:40 <BookserDeWitt>	because as a villian, he only has one goal, and one attitude, he's good for one story and then nothing else
May 10 09:06:45 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	huh. apparently the "she got a big booty so I call her big booty" quote from the rapper 2chainz is supposed to be an anti-joke. Apparently he makes a lot of puns in his songs  and this was supposed to be a subverted expectation joke
May 10 09:06:50 <derram>	and that would be boring as fuck 
May 10 09:06:55 <BookserDeWitt>	he's a boring bad guy, he's more interesting when made into a reluncent hero
May 10 09:06:59 <BookserDeWitt>	he had a good movie
May 10 09:07:03 <BookserDeWitt>	Under the Red Hood
May 10 09:07:06 <BookserDeWitt>	he made a great bad guy
May 10 09:07:15 <BookserDeWitt>	but using him as a bad guy any more is jsut the same thing
May 10 09:07:30 <BookserDeWitt>	over and over, without him changing his mind. still being mad at Batman and the Joker

May 10 09:07:34 <derram>	Weee!
May 10 09:07:49 <BookserDeWitt>	this way he at least can go on adventures and team ups and shit
May 10 09:07:58 <derram>	also, this would require arena style spawns 
May 10 09:08:06 <derram>	which is boooorrrrrriiiiiinnnnnnnngggggggg
May 10 09:08:06 <BookserDeWitt>	and he compared the series itself to "Secret Six"
May 10 09:08:28 <derram>	he really likes that one
May 10 09:08:36 <BookserDeWitt>	because of a line in RHatO about them being mercenaries, even though the plots aren't ever about that
May 10 09:08:52 <BookserDeWitt>	the thing is, Suicide Squad was marketted as the "reaplacement" for Secret Six
May 10 09:09:19 <BookserDeWitt>	bad guys teaming up and going on bad adventures. Suicide Squad. it even had some characters from the Secret Six roster
May 10 09:09:28 <BookserDeWitt>	RHatO never tried to be like Secret Six
May 10 09:09:45 <Bones>	http://i.imgur.com/Kzqv7HZ.jpg
May 10 09:09:57 <BookserDeWitt>	and he used that comparison, saying "they cancelled Secret Six for this?" and that's just not a related comic
May 10 09:10:14 <BookserDeWitt>	He prolly didn't like Suicide Squad either, but I loved it. one of my favorites
May 10 09:10:29 <BookserDeWitt>	i bought the first ark and have it on my shelf
May 10 09:10:37 <derram>	haha, it would be hilarious if they added that old train level to the vanilla map rotatioon

May 10 09:11:23 <BP>	No results
May 10 09:11:51 <BookserDeWitt>	anyway, the point is, this reviewer gets stuck on minor details that aren't really legitmate downsides to the specific issue/series
May 10 09:12:02 <BookserDeWitt>	i can't watch his videos back to back.
May 10 09:12:20 <BookserDeWitt>	i look for his reveiws of things i know, though
May 10 09:12:30 <BookserDeWitt>	i'd like to know what he thinks about Suicide Squad
May 10 09:13:28 <BookserDeWitt>	from what i know about him, i think he's against it. prolly hated the joker cutting his face off
May 10 09:13:44 <derram>	I've been watching his Attack on Bloodhaven review 
May 10 09:13:56 <BookserDeWitt>	thinks it's too dark, or trying to be edgy, or disgraces history, or some shit
May 10 09:14:16 <BookserDeWitt>	That where Bludhaven gets destroyed?
May 10 09:15:04 <derram>	destroyed and then a secret facility built on the remains
May 10 09:15:07 <derram>	for some reason

May 10 09:22:56 <kwuphone>	so I expected the worst
May 10 09:23:15 <derram>	I just get a sour stomach and my body runs hot the next day
May 10 09:23:32 <scriptea>	Derram. Well, you don't really go out much with people...or to parties...so that's a bit expected. :X

May 10 09:23:34 <BP>	0 Days, 0 Hours, 38 Minutes remaining until the next episode
May 10 09:23:37 <kwuphone>	but here I am and I don't feel worse than I normally do in the morning
May 10 09:24:10 <scriptea>	Wait
May 10 09:24:12 <scriptea>	I read that wrong
May 10 09:24:27 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	huh. Weird
May 10 09:24:33 <scriptea>	I read that as "movie type blackout"
May 10 09:24:39 <derram>	haha
May 10 09:24:45 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Also, my terminology teacher told us a story about how he was caught drunk driving once.
May 10 09:24:53 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	that seemed weird.
May 10 09:25:17 <kwuphone>	what an odd thing to tell your students
May 10 09:25:49 <derram>	I love how seriously nerdy his videos are 
May 10 09:26:28 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	yeah seriously kwu. Especially considering he's emirati and most of the class is pakistani, the stigma on alcohol is kinda big
May 10 09:27:05 <derram>	was it a cautionary tale?
May 10 09:27:26 <kwuphone>	oh wow
May 10 09:27:52 <kwuphone>	where was he when he got caught?
May 10 09:27:58 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	yeah, because when the cop told him to get out of the car he accidentally said "no", and it was a cautionary tale about kneejerk reactions to people in authority
May 10 09:28:20 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	He didn't say. I assume not Dubai since that'd be bad
May 10 09:30:43 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	He's an odd fellow. He mentions that he enjoys red wine and tells us his drunken tales, and has a lot of tattoos, all big no-nos in islam, he still shows up for friday prayerse
May 10 09:31:10 <kwuphone>	heh
May 10 09:31:21 <kwuphone>	interesting guy
May 10 09:32:32 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	My new anatomy teacher is wayyyy better than the previous one
May 10 09:32:53 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	for one thing, i can actually understand this one
May 10 09:34:38 <derram>	hehe
May 10 09:35:16 <derram>	your education is an odd one 
May 10 09:35:27 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Still, Anatomy is a bitch of a class.
May 10 09:35:57 <derram>	In China, being taught by people from completely different countries 
May 10 09:36:04 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	plus his name is cool, Dr. Razzak
May 10 09:36:50 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Heh, that's true. Most of the medicine teachers are pakistanis from various countries though. example, Razzak is pakistani from the UK
May 10 09:37:49 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	although my terminology teacher is straight up emirati, with no other national ties
May 10 09:38:26 <BookserDeWitt>	i have no national ties.

May 10 09:43:21 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I'm awful at anything that requires a modicum of dexerit

May 10 09:43:37 <scriptea>	It really isn't that hard.
May 10 09:43:47 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	scrips I can't even tie my shoelaces
May 10 09:43:54 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I usually just wear sandals
May 10 09:43:56 <scriptea>	Do you know what knots your ties are in currently?
May 10 09:43:56 <BookserDeWitt>	pretty simple
May 10 09:44:07 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Nope, scrips
May 10 09:44:43 <scriptea>	:/
May 10 09:45:04 <scriptea>	I'm gonna assume half-windsor, and in that case, they're really freakin' easy.

May 10 09:45:57 <derram>	you can't really throw a ":/" there :I
May 10 09:46:21 <scriptea>	Tying ties is something all males should know how to do.
May 10 09:46:42 <derram>	I don't have a tie :I
May 10 09:47:00 <_b__o__n__e__s__s>	how do you not have a tie
May 10 09:47:00 <scriptea>	...do you never attend any formal events?
May 10 09:47:01 <derram>	had one
May 10 09:47:03 <BookserDeWitt>	that's sexist, tea.
May 10 09:47:07 <BookserDeWitt>	and bull.
May 10 09:47:07 <derram>	not really sure what happened to it
May 10 09:47:09 <_b__o__n__e__s__s>	how does that work
May 10 09:48:10 <scriptea>	"sexist" "bull"

May 10 09:49:25 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I've seen people attend formal events without ties plenty of times.
May 10 09:49:48 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	they never seem worse for wear
May 10 09:49:55 <BookserDeWitt>	not everyone needs ties
May 10 09:49:56 <scriptea>	inb4 they didn't own a tie
May 10 09:52:05 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Some of them I know own ties, they just felt they'd look better without one. and in some cases they do look a lot better without
May 10 09:52:21 <BookserDeWitt>	it's not for everyone
May 10 09:52:29 <BookserDeWitt>	not everyone always looks good in ties
May 10 09:52:35 <BookserDeWitt>	there are other styles
May 10 09:52:43 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	personally I look ganglier than usual in a tie
May 10 09:52:58 <scriptea>	Depends on the outfit, and if you don't have a lot of expendable cash, then usually it is better to go without a tie, than to have the tie clash.
May 10 09:53:56 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	huh. I just noticed that Ryuuko has prominent incisors.
May 10 09:54:18 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	she got them little fangs yo

May 10 16:07:51 <wolfieshy>	opening the box was the avatar state
May 10 16:08:01 <wolfieshy>	this is turning into a stretch
May 10 16:08:18 <kwuphone>	aaaa
May 10 16:08:23 <Nagashizuri>	Are you talking about LoK, wolfie?
May 10 16:08:40 <kwuphone>	mlp?
May 10 16:08:46 <terra>	http://i.imgur.com/clZA97y.jpg
May 10 16:08:52 <Nagashizuri>	I'm confused.
May 10 16:09:55 <Monoclebear>	that sound is kinda like the inception BWAAAM
May 10 16:10:04 <kwuphone>	a bit
May 10 16:10:16 <kwuphone>	inception bwaaam was cool
May 10 16:10:24 <Nagashizuri>	It was.
May 10 16:10:38 <Nagashizuri>	~yt inception mombasa
May 10 16:10:38 <BP>	https://youtu.be/pUwszL6J81I > Inception (2010) Mombasa Suite (Soundtrack OST) | 155,553 | 98% | 0:04:54
May 10 16:10:42 <kwuphone>	brass instruments playing in a low register and the fundamental pitch disappearing
May 10 16:10:57 <Nagashizuri>	^ One of my favourite bits from the soundtrack.
May 10 16:11:21 <BookserDeWitt>	I liked that movie.
May 10 16:11:21 <kwuphone>	I'm not too much of a Hans Zimmer fan
May 10 16:11:27 <kwuphone>	he's too minimalist for me
May 10 16:11:28 <fionna>	i lurve zimmer
May 10 16:11:30 <BookserDeWitt>	it wasn't mind-blowingly good or anything, but i liked it
May 10 16:11:34 <Monoclebear>	not seen inception yet
May 10 16:11:42 <Nagashizuri>	A lot of his stuff can be pretty samey. But when he does good, he does good.
May 10 16:11:46 <BookserDeWitt>	once of the few movies i have on dvd
May 10 16:11:53 <BookserDeWitt>	it was cheap
May 10 16:12:06 <kwuphone>	Inception is a heist movie, and it's a good one at that.
May 10 16:12:09 <BookserDeWitt>	^
May 10 16:12:13 <BookserDeWitt>	it's a great heist movie
May 10 16:12:19 <Nagashizuri>	I love heist movies.
May 10 16:12:24 <terra>	http://i.imgur.com/Zohv54D.jpg
May 10 16:12:24 <BookserDeWitt>	also, in some ways, the apposite of a heist movie
May 10 16:12:25 <Nagashizuri>	So fucking much.
May 10 16:12:26 <Monoclebear>	for people who are not much into this kind of sci-fi it was apparantly mindblowing
May 10 16:12:34 <BookserDeWitt>	sneak in, leave something (an idea) behind
May 10 16:12:39 <BookserDeWitt>	inceptiooon
May 10 16:12:43 <kwuphone>	get the team together and go to super restricted place with super high risk
May 10 16:13:00 <BookserDeWitt>	it was pretty clever
May 10 16:13:07 <Nagashizuri>	Favourite heist movie?
May 10 16:13:23 <wolfieshy>	[05/10 16:08:23] <Nagashizuri> Are you talking about LoK, wolfie?

May 10 20:41:02 <Books>	he can be friendly without being cool

May 10 20:45:14 <zooman>	Like, he seems like a cool dude with enough money to fund an expensive hobby
May 10 20:45:21 <zooman>	what about having an expensive hobby makes him an asshole?
May 10 20:45:32 <zooman>	Are people who play MTG and WH40K assholes?

May 10 21:21:54 <Books>	the amount of money someone is not directly related to how hard they work
May 10 21:22:28 <Books>	it's pretty arbitrary, outside of some general rules like "if you never try to get a better paying job, you'll stay poor"
May 10 21:22:35 <AttackTheMoon>	http://mutantradio.org/listen.m3u
May 10 21:22:54 <zooman>	No, but they made that money themselves
May 10 21:23:14 <Books>	but one company can pay more or less than another company, for the same exact job. it's not because one is objectively harder and more worth doing, it's because they worked at a higher-paying company

May 11 03:06:40 <derram>	so do you want to ignore them from everyone or just one person 
May 11 03:08:07 <scriptea>	It was annoying, but someone was doing it to the server (I think, I'm not too sure WHAT he was doing), and since Hexchat uses the windows sounds, but doesn't have a volume button in the mixer, I just disabled the "message" sound in Windows.
May 11 03:08:31 <derram>	huh, mine is in the mixer 
May 11 03:08:44 <derram>	and just ignore ctcp from that guy

May 11 03:09:30 <scriptea>	I fixed it, it doesn't matter now
May 11 03:09:39 <derram>	art an ignore, then go up to the window - > ignore menu option 
May 11 03:10:01 <derram>	you can do it with a command, but confusing 
May 11 03:10:21 <scriptea>	Oh, I see.

May 11 05:52:14 <alt>	thing is, i don't want to have to include the arguments as well
May 11 05:52:23 <alt>	otherwise i'd just do the function pointer garbage

May 11 05:53:27 <alt>	api
May 11 05:53:41 <Bovine___>	so you need a c-style function to pass in?
May 11 05:54:06 <alt>	i think so
May 11 05:54:10 <Echo>	I feel like you're probably stuck either using function pointers or wrapping them somehow
May 11 05:54:26 <alt>	yeah i was gonna wrap them but it would be such a pain
May 11 05:54:34 <alt>	i could automate it but then i'd have to clean up a ton
May 11 05:54:34 <Echo>	I probably wouldn't suggest wrapping them since I'm not sure if the compiler would optimize that away
May 11 05:54:47 <Echo>	and it would be even more work than doign the typedef with function pointers
May 11 05:54:58 <alt>	most of them are only needed on startup so that wouldn't be much of an issue
May 11 05:55:09 <alt>	inline probably wouldn't help anyway
May 11 05:55:10 <Echo>	this is where C#'s new roselyn api would be handy

May 11 06:40:06 <Echo>	might keep it in python
May 11 06:40:13 <Echo>	the real thing is just cleaning it up
May 11 06:40:21 <Echo>	what i really want is so that each command is its own file
May 11 06:40:28 <Echo>	and those files are dynamically loaded
May 11 06:40:42 <Bovine___>	that's a pain in python

May 11 06:52:57 <bilb>	It may not offer complete parity with MS's .net library, but it's stable enough
May 11 06:53:38 <bilb>	Might not always generate the most efficient code when it compiles in some cases, but ehhh
May 11 06:54:29 <derram>	prolly just means he finds mono to be more work

May 11 07:01:34 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	in the second episode of Watamote, tomoki's actually being cheerful near the beginning and it seems like she's gonna be happy. Then it cuts to her puking her guts out in an alley. She had a bigger breakfast than usual and chides herself for trying things she's not used to. Slipping right back into her old ways just because of a sour stomach

May 11 07:27:19 *	derram boops esplin 
May 11 07:28:55 <scriptea>	When you declare you hand is "ready to win" aka tenpai, and you put 1000 points in (everyone starts with 25k), and if someone places your tile that would cause you to win, you can call "Ron" and win, or if you draw it from the wall yourself, you "Tsumo" and get an extra yaku or "win condition" and that makes your hand worth more points. 
May 11 07:29:57 <scriptea>	Both because if you Ron off a tile, you only steal points from that person, whereas if you Tsumo, you take it from everyone. And having more yaku increases the value of your hand.
May 11 07:31:29 <scriptea>	I think I just hate periods.
May 11 07:33:50 <derram>	still new
May 11 07:34:10 <derram>	prolly rules to points you don't understand yet
May 11 07:34:21 <scriptea>	It's not the points that got me.
May 11 07:34:34 <scriptea>	I "lost" in that I didn't "win"
May 11 07:35:09 <scriptea>	Well, okay, in total I lost, but I should have won that hand.
May 11 07:36:09 <derram>	wow, confusing 
May 11 07:36:25 <derram>	you'll be able to win once you can explain why you're losing :3
May 11 07:36:28 <scriptea>	It is a VERY confusing game.

May 12 06:45:10 <Monoclebear>	personally I found his opinion about TVs retarded
May 12 06:47:28 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Well I can imagine it'd be a bit frustrating for people to constantly be correcting him on the message of the book he wrote... according to what I'm reading, after he explained that it's not about censorship, the whole class pretty much agreed that, yeah, it's about censorship, causing him to storm out.
May 12 06:47:48 <Monoclebear>	well it is
May 12 06:48:18 <Saltbearer>	HOW silly one must be to even consider that
May 12 06:48:28 <Monoclebear>	if he tried to write something else, then he is such a terrible writer that its good again
May 12 06:49:02 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	but it isn't. It can be alternatively interepreted that way, but it remains an alternate interpretation. Death of the author is all fine and well for literary interpretation, but the alternate meanings cannot supercede the established one
May 12 06:49:57 <Monoclebear>	Yeah, I agree with that, but I think this case is somewhat special
May 12 06:50:06 <Saltbearer>	it s not as if no one, none
May 12 06:50:24 <Monoclebear>	because I read the book and I just couldnt see the point he was trying to make

May 12 07:52:52 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	They all seemed like deconstructions of standard protagonists.
May 12 07:53:06 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Michael was the slick bank robber who gets away in the end
May 12 07:53:19 <kwulhu>	poni
May 12 07:53:29 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	only to have his life collapse around him as he whiles his days away sleeping in front of his pool
May 12 07:53:33 <derram>	:3
May 12 07:53:36 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	while his family is on the slow burn to disintigration
May 12 07:53:52 <derram>	but, prolly not gonna see another new episode until october 
May 12 07:53:57 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Franklin was the "thug who aspires for something better"
May 12 07:55:12 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	he's an egotistical ass who thinks he's surrounded by idiots. He lives in a pit of self loathing. His only real friend, Lamarr, he constantly insults and belittles, and practically drops him like an old hat when things start going his way
May 12 07:56:43 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Trevor is the "lol psycho" character. Except he's a twisted, violent fuck who runs a meth empire and regularly rapes and tortures people for the hell of it. In fact, you can sell young adults to a cannibal cult in the mountains as him
May 12 07:57:09 *	zooman has quit (Ping timeout: 61 seconds)
May 12 07:58:40 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	theres one scene where he murders a somewhat nice, sympathetic couple. It's not shown onscreen but he leaves their apartment drenched in blood.
May 12 07:59:20 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Plus  he's clearly taking advantage of the character Wade, who has some ambiguos mental disorder or something
May 12 07:59:39 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	and keeps him hooked on meth (although that's from one-off lines during some early missions)
May 12 07:59:43 <derram>	complicated roster :I
May 12 07:59:55 <derram>	I just wanna blow things up and run from the cops
May 12 08:00:01 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	You can still do that.
May 12 08:00:17 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Still, I think this roster hurts the characters rather than helps
May 12 08:00:44 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	They're not in the slightest bit sympathetic. They're just shallow people who do bad things for money
May 12 08:01:08 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Up until maybe midway through the game, there's really no motivation besides the immediate "I need money for things"
May 12 08:01:27 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	At least in GTA4 you were looking for the soldier who betrayed your squad
May 12 08:01:36 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	at least in san andreas, you were looking for your mom's killer
May 12 08:02:16 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	hell, vice city was about getting a shit ton of drug money back for your boss. That's at the least more sympathetic than these three.

May 12 10:45:05 <kwuphone>	um
May 12 10:45:19 <kwuphone>	pretty cheap
May 12 10:45:25 <derram>	depends where you live
May 12 10:45:43 <derram>	usually handled by the individual states and cities
May 12 10:45:49 <MonocleEmperor>	its not standarsized?
May 12 10:45:55 <derram>	nope!
May 12 10:45:57 <kwuphone>	to get on the L in Chicago, you pay $2.25 and it doesn't matter where you get off
May 12 10:46:05 <MonocleEmperor>	seems complicated
May 12 10:46:31 <kwuphone>	in Washington DC, the cost depends on how far your trip is
May 12 10:46:31 <kwuphone>	also
May 12 10:46:41 <derram>	Well, you're not using those to go between states
May 12 10:46:54 <MonocleEmperor>	here it is about 1.50 for a single ticket, 4 for an all day card, and 15 for a month
May 12 10:47:09 <kwuphone>	on the Metra (a train used to connect Chicago to the suburbs), you pay depending how far your trip is

May 12 10:47:42 <kwuphone>	I think tje
May 12 10:47:47 <kwuphone>	the design is kind of elegant
May 12 10:47:51 <kwuphone>	wheel and spokes
May 12 10:47:55 <derram>	it's used to be 15 bucks a month for a card here, but they bumped it up to 30
May 12 10:48:39 <MonocleEmperor>	hah, they are gonna lower the prices a monthcard here soon
May 12 10:48:42 <kwuphone>	there's actually a plan to add more tracks
May 12 10:48:58 <kwuphone>	heh
May 12 10:49:14 <kwuphone>	Mono: have you seen Whole Train?
May 12 10:49:19 <MonocleEmperor>	?
May 12 10:49:46 <kwuphone>	it's a German movie about graffiti artists
May 12 10:50:03 <MonocleEmperor>	nah
May 12 10:50:06 <kwuphone>	and a monthcard is a huge plot point
May 12 10:50:20 <MonocleEmperor>	havent seen it
May 12 10:50:36 <kwuphone>	heh
May 12 10:51:25 <kwuphone>	it was actually filmed mostly in poland because German public transport authorities wouldn't cooperate
May 12 10:52:15 <kwuphone>	like the name suggests, they actually covered a whole train in graffiti
May 12 10:52:22 <MonocleEmperor>	and thats the reason why our public transport system works so well
May 12 10:52:46 <MonocleEmperor>	because atleast there people do their fucking job
May 12 10:52:56 <kwuphone>	I wish Americans liked public transport here
May 12 10:53:03 <MonocleEmperor>	except the train people
May 12 10:53:16 <MonocleEmperor>	trains are always late here
May 12 10:53:38 <MonocleEmperor>	and if it is on time then i cant leave on time

May 12 10:53:42 <kwuphone>	honestly
May 12 10:53:48 <kwuphone>	what gets in the way is individualism
May 12 10:54:09 <kwuphone>	we all need to have our personal cars and houses
May 12 10:54:53 <kwuphone>	trains are so much more efficient but they require people to cooperate
May 12 10:55:00 <MonocleEmperor>	the reason I heard is that many americans think your Public transport is shit
May 12 10:55:49 <kwuphone>	I shouldn't have said "liked"
May 12 10:56:11 <kwuphone>	I should have said "believed in the potential value of"
May 12 10:56:30 <MonocleEmperor>	they did
May 12 10:56:35 <MonocleEmperor>	then they tried it
May 12 10:57:11 <kwuphone>	the trains were cutting-edge when they were built
May 12 10:57:41 <kwuphone>	but we don't want to spend the money to modernize them
May 12 10:59:25 <kwuphone>	I want to learn about trains :3
May 12 10:59:41 <kwuphone>	the system is so fascinating
May 12 11:00:57 <kwuphone>	also
May 12 11:01:16 <kwuphone>	they're starting to phase in the new L trains to the purple line :3

May 12 15:54:22 <derram>	he's good as long as he doesn't announce he's the murderer
May 12 15:54:23 <terra>	no nicotine or anything though, just a flavor
May 12 15:54:23 <Scix_s>	and it was so nice
May 12 15:54:26 <terra>	i just enjoy smoking
May 12 15:54:35 <Scix_s>	it was like, a wet feeling
May 12 15:54:38 <Augie>	hows the adery gmod server?

May 12 15:55:59 <jeep8790>	frozen is ok
May 12 15:56:01 <terra>	i've bought bd before
May 12 15:56:09 <terra>	it all depends if it makes a smell or smoke or anything like that
May 12 15:56:12 <Scix_s>	hah
May 12 15:56:13 <Echo>	Augie, I have one set up but it's not technically an adery one
May 12 15:56:19 <Augie>	oh
May 12 15:56:29 <Scix_s>	terra, it makes a vapor that smells like the flavor you use
May 12 15:56:30 <terra>	if i can smoke a whole cart in my closed room and then stop no one should be able to tell
May 12 15:56:36 <terra>	o
May 12 15:56:36 <terra>	hmm
May 12 15:56:49 <Scix_s>	yeah, i smoke in my dorm all the time
May 12 15:57:07 <Scix_s>	its like a really weak air freshener level of scent
May 12 15:57:26 <terra>	do you inhale?
May 12 15:57:29 <Scix_s>	we had 4 people with them in winter, and that was the only time we were able to make a cloud inside a cold car
May 12 15:57:31 <terra>	or is it like a cigar
May 12 15:57:49 <Scix_s>	you can do whatever you want, since no nicotine
May 12 15:57:59 <terra>	ballller
May 12 15:58:03 <Scix_s>	i usually just inhale to my mouth and then blow it out
May 12 15:58:13 <terra>	i just really enjoy the feeling of smoking
May 12 15:58:18 <Scix_s>	but going throigh your nose makes some flavors different/better
May 12 15:58:29 <terra>	would prolly cut back on my shit of biting my fingernails
May 12 15:58:31 <Scix_s>	i'm doing it now, helps to focus me on studying

May 12 16:00:03 <Scix_s>	you'll get tired of the flavor
May 12 16:00:19 <Scix_s>	smokeless image offers sampler packs, which give you 5 different flavors
May 12 16:00:34 <terra>	whats the difference between auto and manual battery packs
May 12 16:00:37 <Scix_s>	jeep, this is cool
May 12 16:00:47 <derram>	cartomizers suck, tanks 4lyfe
May 12 16:00:48 <Scix_s>	auto detects you sucking
May 12 16:00:49 <Scix_s>	manual is a button to turn it on
May 12 16:00:52 <Scix_s>	haha
May 12 16:01:04 <Scix_s>	i like tanks, but cartos are easy to start out with
May 12 16:01:22 <jeep8790>	ill auto detect you sucking
May 12 16:01:28 <Scix_s>	:3
May 12 16:01:49 *	Augie funs chat
May 12 16:02:04 <Scix_s>	manual give you a harder hit too, since you can press and hold right before you suck to preheat the carto/tank
May 12 16:02:08 <terra>	yeah
May 12 16:02:09 *	Echo bites augie
May 12 16:02:12 <terra>	i'd prolly like manual more

May 12 16:02:35 <Scix_s>	sometimes i wish i could just hold it with my mouth
May 12 16:02:47 <Scix_s>	but i think the hit is stronger and worth it
May 12 16:02:51 <Scix_s>	with manual
May 12 16:05:08 <terra>	30 bux
May 12 16:05:11 <terra>	makes it kinda tempting

May 12 16:52:18 <jeep8790>	^
May 12 16:52:27 <MonocleEmperor>	weird, when I was in america people told me catholics are the mostly crazy ones
May 12 16:52:36 <AttackTheMoon>	LOL NO
May 12 16:52:40 <AttackTheMoon>	that would be biptists
May 12 16:52:43 <jeep8790>	they were probably protestants
May 12 16:52:48 <AttackTheMoon>	^^
May 12 16:52:50 <kwulampshade>	Actually, American Catholics are often liberal since they're descended from Irish, Poles, and Latinos

May 12 16:53:44 <kwulampshade>	but yeah
May 12 16:53:50 <kwulampshade>	Baptists are the crazy ones
May 12 16:53:58 <MonocleEmperor>	I went often to church until I was about 15
May 12 16:54:19 <jeep8790>	its like "its find if youre gay because we love everyone, but we cant let you get married because reasons"
May 12 16:54:22 <kwulampshade>	Baptists are the ones who hold up "GOD HATES FAGS" signs
May 12 16:54:22 <MonocleEmperor>	but I never really believed

May 13 02:54:24 <BP>	Protest the Hero is a Canadian progressive metal band from Whitby, Ontario. Originally named Happy Go Lucky, the band changed their name to Protest the Hero shortly before releasing their debut EP, Search for the Truth, in 2002. In 2005, the band released their first full-length album Kezia on the indie label Underground Operations. On January 23, 2006, the band signed with Vagrant...
May 13 02:54:37 <zoonig>	this band is pretty neat
May 13 02:54:51 <zoonig>	thought they were metalcore whehn i first heard them

May 13 05:22:33 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Actually, the manga has wose pacing problems than the show
May 13 05:22:48 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	wose
May 13 05:22:50 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	worse

May 13 05:23:11 <NoteAss>	#rekt
May 13 05:23:18 <zoonig>	also the turning into a titan bullshit was so fucking retarded
May 13 05:23:41 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	that's like
May 13 05:23:43 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	the crux of the plot
May 13 05:23:47 <zoonig>	yeah
May 13 05:23:51 <zoonig>	and it was terrible
May 13 05:24:00 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I disagree.

May 13 05:24:07 <NoteAss>	prove me wrong
May 13 05:24:11 <NoteAss>	you can't because I'm right
May 13 05:24:12 <zoonig>	The first 5 or so episodes were amazing, though
May 13 05:24:17 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Otherwise the show would be a stream of teenagers getting smacked out of the air
May 13 05:25:02 <zoonig>	Or they could have gotten better at fighting them

May 13 05:25:47 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Oh because the best of the best regularly losing an uphill battle would suddenly turn around in an organic way without titan killin' mode Eren?
May 13 05:25:53 <zoonig>	But even though the plot was stupid retarded, its one of the best arted and animated animes of all time
May 13 05:26:00 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	THe show is basically about flesh gundams!

May 13 10:21:05 <Booklets>	Not a huge fan of his humor but its not unwatchable. Let's me know about new comics
May 13 10:21:29 <Booklets>	He hates a lot of things
May 13 10:21:32 <derram>	well, I think he sticks to stuff he thinks is bad
May 13 10:21:37 <Booklets>	Like all the new 52
May 13 10:21:53 <Booklets>	Which is why I read comics at all
May 13 10:22:38 <Booklets>	He mentions it a lot
May 13 10:23:28 <Booklets>	And a lot if the reboots and things I like or at least don't mind
May 13 10:25:12 <Booklets>	He just likes the classics and hates change, which is in the nature of comics
May 13 10:25:21 <Booklets>	Embrace it, sl
May 13 10:25:39 <Booklets>	S'all I'm saying
May 13 10:26:44 <derram>	I think a lot of the stuff he liked got axed 
May 13 10:26:59 <derram>	still seems to be reading it, though 
May 13 10:27:44 <Booklets>	Comics ending is also in the nature of comics. 
May 13 10:28:28 <Booklets>	They have to try to appeal to new readers all the time, which often means leaving behind old ideas/characters
May 13 10:28:39 <Booklets>	Lots of people hate that
May 13 10:28:54 <Booklets>	You know they changed Mr freeze
May 13 10:29:21 <Booklets>	He's delusional now, wife isn't real, just a crazy guy.
May 13 10:29:30 <derram>	huh
May 13 10:29:40 <derram>	that's terrible :I
May 13 10:29:59 <Booklets>	He's not really any more interesting now, but I understand why they wanted a change
May 13 10:30:22 <Booklets>	What he was changed to isn't good, but them trying to change him was a good ide
May 13 10:31:11 <Booklets>	They really couldn't use the character in new stories anymore, he was good for a few, then he doesn't have anything new to bring to the table
May 13 10:31:41 <derram>	but it really kills the character :I
May 13 10:31:48 <Booklets>	He was just used in group villain stories for decades without being featured in anything
May 13 10:33:11 <Booklets>	If they wanted him to still be an interesting character, he needed to change. Otherwise everyone knows what he is going to do
May 13 10:33:54 <derram>	yeah, but now there's no motivation aside from crazy
May 13 10:33:57 <Booklets>	He was a dull character, for ongoing comics, that doesn't really work. They have to at least try to keep him interesting over time
May 13 10:34:02 <derram>	and batman has enough crazy bad guys
May 13 10:34:13 <Booklets>	His motivation is the same, now he's delusional

May 13 10:37:16 <derram>	he's still unusable 
May 13 10:37:34 <Booklets>	Little early to tell
May 13 10:37:38 <derram>	beforehand, someone could make him do what they wanted by taking his wife
May 13 10:37:50 <derram>	now, he's just some crazy guy
May 13 10:38:08 <Booklets>	He's only been featured in one arc, there hasn't been time for the writers to use him again
May 13 10:39:02 <Booklets>	That's still not being featured. He's just in group villain stories
May 13 10:40:02 <Booklets>	Fair enough, they could just stop using him
May 13 10:40:12 <Booklets>	But comics don't do that very often
May 13 10:40:19 <Booklets>	Stop using charactera
May 13 10:40:57 <Booklets>	They should just stop using Mr freeze and Zsasz.
May 13 10:41:55 *	kwulhu freezes Booklets 
May 13 10:44:06 <Booklets>	Again, I don't think he's more interesting how, but I admire that they at least tried to change him. The decision to change him was good, but the writer didn't pull through.
May 13 10:44:35 <Booklets>	Mr freeze isn't even the best cold themed character
May 13 10:46:22 <derram>	he was always my favorite of that lot, though 
May 13 10:46:51 <Booklets>	Captain Cold has a better freeze gun though
May 13 10:47:50 <Booklets>	He's gonna be in the Justice League 
May 13 10:48:43 <Booklets>	Mr Freeze is just always in Arkham until there's a big jailbreak and he leaves, to join a group effort to fight batman

May 13 11:32:42 <zoonig>	Nah, i have splints, ive broken fingers before
May 13 11:32:49 <Books>	if you're fingers are legit broken, you will need to  be re-set or something. at least have someone take a look
May 13 11:32:56 <Books>	it could heal wrong. :/
May 13 11:33:05 <Books>	it depends on the injury what you need, zoo
May 13 11:33:13 <Books>	a splint might be all you need but you don't know
May 13 11:33:23 <Books>	you should have a doctor look at it before you shrug it off
May 13 11:33:23 <zoonig>	Yeah but we dont have insurance
May 13 11:33:34 <Books>	having fingers heal wrong can fuck you up for a long time, zoo
May 13 11:33:46 <zoonig>	Ive broken fingers a few times before from skateboarding dude

May 13 11:35:03 <zoonig>	its not a big deal
May 13 11:35:08 <Books>	"like ten"
May 13 11:35:14 <Books>	heh.

May 13 11:35:45 <zoonig>	Heh, yeah
May 13 11:36:09 <zoonig>	What im most worried for now is for my dad to get home and see one of our chairs in splinters
May 13 11:36:10 <Books>	i just imagine some punk skator kid coming home, holding his fingers to his chest and crying going "help, i just broke, like, ten of my fingers,"
May 13 11:36:26 <Books>	make a new chair
May 13 11:37:05 <zoonig>	I dont think i can match the quality
May 13 11:37:21 <Books>	learn how

May 13 11:37:26 <Books>	spend years in training
May 13 11:37:34 <Books>	make and sell chairs for the next few years
May 13 11:37:40 <zoonig>	Before my dad gets home in seven hours?
May 13 11:37:44 <Books>	build a perfect chair to replace the one that broke
May 13 11:37:51 <Books>	and no one will ever notice
May 13 11:37:52 <Books>	yes
May 13 11:37:58 <Books>	gotta go fast, though
May 13 11:38:05 <Books>	make a chair out of the bones of your brother.

May 13 11:38:38 <Books>	fix that.
May 13 11:38:46 <zoonig>	Nah, im not    mad at him anymore
May 13 11:38:50 <derram>	doesn't need to be dead to remove bones
May 13 11:38:54 <zoonig>	though he did break both my headset and my headphones
May 13 11:39:21 <Books>	people lose bones all the time without dying
May 13 11:39:36 <Books>	there's sometihng so few people expirence
May 13 11:39:47 <Books>	and that is seeing your own limb decaying
May 13 11:39:55 <Books>	or seeing your own bones, detached from your body
May 13 11:39:57 <derram>	that happen before you got into the fight?
May 13 11:40:12 <Books>	can you imagine how that must feel?
May 13 11:40:17 <zoonig>	Its what spurred it
May 13 11:40:25 <zoonig>	He came to my bed, started kicking and screaming
May 13 11:40:27 <Books>	how many people have seen their own bones, i mean
May 13 11:40:33 <zoonig>	Ripped my headset apart, tore up my dheadphones
May 13 11:40:37 <Books>	oh, mfw Bones isn't even in chat.
May 13 11:40:48 <derram>	yeah, tell your parents about that 
May 13 11:40:57 <zoonig>	And then when he found his headphones
May 13 11:41:02 <zoonig>	He ruined my shit for nothing
May 13 11:41:05 <Books>	what a cunthole.
May 13 11:41:27 <zoonig>	I wanna be upset about him wrecking my shit
May 13 11:41:36 <zoonig>	but im mostly just upset that i let myself go like that
May 13 11:41:54 <Books>	that you got angry when he prvoked you?
May 13 11:42:07 <zoonig>	Yeah
May 13 11:42:21 <Books>	it's not like it was some stranger on the street
May 13 11:42:25 <zoonig>	Im generally very mild, and when i get upset i get really sad
May 13 11:42:31 <Books>	it's jsutified to get angry

May 13 12:35:52 <zoonig>	i think i might have to rewatch all of power rangers
May 13 12:36:01 <Books>	it's pretty common for his sybol to be red now, instead of black or yellow

May 13 13:31:09 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Nah, looks like christian propaganda.  Look at the chalk board.  It's showing what a christian would say to dumb down atheistic ideas.  It also makes Dawkins look retarded.
May 13 13:31:19 <zoonig>	WATCH A CHILDS HAND DUKE IT OUT WITH HIS ARCHNEMESIS, DAWKINS FACE
May 13 13:31:22 <derram>	caricature is a classic form
May 13 13:31:25 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Although, the kid's comment does nothing to answer Dawkin's question.
May 13 13:31:30 <derram>	been around that long by now
May 13 13:31:37 <zoonig>	I think its christian bullshit to slanderize atheism
May 13 13:31:39 <zoonig>	but thats just me
May 13 13:31:50 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Is he saying that God doesn't know who created him because even he doesn't have the ability to see it?
May 13 13:31:54 <RisenLM>	It's an equally ignorant stance on Christian ideals though
May 13 13:32:17 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Or is he just saying that humans can't see or hear god, but he can still be there?
May 13 13:32:18 <zoonig>	I think thats not as far off, risen
May 13 13:32:22 <zoonig>	^twi
May 13 13:32:42 <zoonig>	The kid is saying "just because you cant phyically interact with god doesnt mean he doesnt exist, you stupid ass atheist"
May 13 13:33:05 <derram>	http://i.imgur.com/P13d11T.png
May 13 13:33:10 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	If it's the former, it means God isn't all-knowing, if it's the latter, then he's not answering Dawkin's question.
May 13 13:33:28 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	which would make his comment a non-sequitor and rather pointless.
May 13 13:34:02 <RisenLM>	You're reading too far into this
May 13 13:34:11 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	YOU CANNOT READ TOO FAR INTO A THING, RISEN.
May 13 13:34:13 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

May 13 13:34:47 <RisenLM>	You're reading too far into something whose purpose is only to aggrivate someone somewhere and therefore falling into its trap*
May 13 13:35:25 <zoonig>	its a trap, tswi
May 13 13:35:25 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	That sounds like a lot of words to say 'u mad bro' risen.
May 13 13:35:34 <zoonig>	TWI
May 13 13:35:36 <zoonig>	ITS A TRAP
May 13 13:35:39 <zoonig>	YOURE TRAPT NAO
May 13 13:35:44 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	And just because I'm overanalyzing a thing doesn't mean I'm mad.

May 13 13:36:08 <zoonig>	Nice meme, risen
May 13 13:36:21 <RisenLM>	I'll meme you
May 13 13:36:27 <derram>	hehe, people in the comments are confused about the meaning as well
May 13 13:36:29 <zoonig>	Dp it baby
May 13 13:36:30 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	And EVEN IF I WAS MAD
May 13 13:36:32 <zoonig>	Do*
May 13 13:36:36 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	it wouldn't negate my valid points.
May 13 13:37:08 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	So saying 'u mad bro' is merely an attempt at derailment of the conversation
May 13 13:37:24 <derram>	http://daletoons.blogspot.com/2014/04/for-love-of-jeb.html
May 13 13:37:31 <derram>	yeah, dude just traces his shit
May 13 13:37:43 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	because you're attempting to abandon the discussion due to your lack of valid points, and put the person arguing against you on the defensive about whether or not they're mad.
May 13 13:38:22 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	because being emotionally invested in a situation to the point of anger is then perceived to be a bad thing.
May 13 13:40:37 <RisenLM>	You're inferring that's what I was saying
May 13 13:40:51 <zoonig>	Risenlordm?
May 13 13:40:52 <zoonig>	more like
May 13 13:40:55 <zoonig>	memelordman
May 13 13:40:55 <derram>	it is the default internet debating tactic 
May 13 13:40:57 <RisenLM>	Instead of what I actually meant, in that you're getting too invested in something that has no intrinsic value.
May 13 13:41:27 <derram>	though, the point of art is to spark discussion 
May 13 13:41:39 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	^ @ Derram, and I realize that Risen.
May 13 13:41:46 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	That's why I said there's no too far enough.
May 13 13:41:54 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	*there is only not too far enough
May 13 13:42:04 <RisenLM>	I think physical confrontation over something is too far
May 13 13:42:32 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Well

May 13 13:42:33 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	duh

May 14 00:03:55 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	It says to place 6 tokens on the card.  At the end of each turn, roll 2 dice.  For each 1 or 2 that you roll, you place another token on the card.
May 14 00:04:10 *	kwulhu kwubrates

May 14 00:05:08 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	You can remove the tokens by moving to a certain space on the board and spending clue tokens
May 14 00:05:09 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	HOWEVER
May 14 00:05:28 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	I had just spent all of my clue tokens on sealing a gate before drawing that card.
May 14 00:05:44 <RisenLM>	This is all gibberish
May 14 00:05:46 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	So I moved to a spot on the board where I could collect more tokens, and got 4 more.

May 14 00:07:17 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	So in 4 turns, I hit 10 tokens, and now all of my elder signs are gone.
May 14 00:07:37 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Everything's fucked.
May 14 00:07:56 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	I CAME SO CLOSE TO WINNING A SINGLE PLAYER GAME OF ARKHAM HORROR
May 14 00:08:06 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	But now my chances are slim to none.
May 14 00:08:12 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Fuckin

May 14 00:08:20 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	It is.
May 14 00:08:23 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	For this game, it really is.
May 14 00:08:33 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	I mean, I can still win by killing the Ancient one.
May 14 00:08:44 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	but doing that as the only character is next to impossible.
May 14 00:09:04 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Or by closing all the gates, but that's not going to be possible with one character unless I get exceedingly lucky.
May 14 00:09:36 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	So my only option was managing to seal 6 gate locations with Elder signs.

May 14 02:19:34 <Zoomayne_s>	Ugh TiA has become so hateful
May 14 02:19:38 <Zoomayne_s>	It used to be so silly
May 14 02:20:06 <Zoomayne_s>	Like "look at these wacky tumblrites with their silly special snowflakeness"
May 14 02:20:14 <Zoomayne_s>	now its like "kill all tumblrites"
May 14 02:20:49 <Zoomayne_s>	but no reddit is a toxic plACE

May 14 02:22:54 <BP>	A condition among women that manifests itself as a stretching of the skin above and below the woman's breast.  In essence, the breast itself falls to a level even with the woman's stomach but continues to originate at her chest.  Most prevalently affects late night waitresses working at seedy diners.
May 14 02:23:18 <derram>	ah 
May 14 02:23:49 <derram>	yeah, I always figured that was bullshit and only served as a way to insult fat people 
May 14 02:24:06 <Saltbearer>	TiA isn't really that hateful aside from hating idiocy
May 14 02:24:30 <derram>	yeah, but why even acknowledge it 
May 14 02:25:01 <Zoomayne_s>	The overall tone of the subreddit has gotten more hateful, i think
May 14 02:25:02 <Saltbearer>	because people's idiocy can be as funny as it is rage inducing
May 14 02:25:04 <derram>	it's just a "we're better than them" circlejerk

May 14 03:00:03 <Sparkles>	Hypnosis is zombocom
May 14 03:00:26 <loversh>	hypnosis isn't about making you act like a chicken
May 14 03:00:55 <derram>	the popular notion of hypnosis is a crock 
May 14 03:01:41 <loversh>	it's relaxing to the sound of somebodys voice, letting them speak to you with positive relaxing words. 
May 14 03:01:47 <loversh>	think guided meditation.
May 14 03:01:53 <RisenLM>	Yeah. It's not like what media and porn depict.
May 14 03:01:59 <loversh>	you can let it be whatever you want it to be.

May 14 05:32:16 <derram>	Spammy, try using more traditional music for the language you're singing in 
May 14 05:32:30 <scriptea>	in the "aftergame lobby" I admitted I was drunk, a couple of people on the enemy team thought I was cool, we started talking...AND THEY LIVE 8 MILES AWAY
May 14 05:32:42 <derram>	trying to rhyme in Japanese with a beat made for English is silly 
May 14 05:32:45 <scriptea>	Small, fuckin' world, man

May 14 05:32:56 <derram>	hehe

May 14 05:36:08 <Spammy>	Ido would have a word with you
May 14 05:36:19 <derram>	makes sense. if you've spent a lot of time on the Internet growing up 
May 14 05:36:45 <scriptea>	...I seriously can't wrap my mind around this

May 14 05:38:20 <scriptea>	A big city is a big city
May 14 05:38:26 <miggyb>	so nicks need to be merged, and what else?
May 14 05:38:42 <scriptea>	40k people (both cities included) is 40k people...in millions.
May 14 05:38:49 <derram>	larger collection size

May 14 05:40:38 <miggyb>	nah, i can change it to total stats if you guys want, but it makes stats less "useful," i think. it becomes harder for ranks to move around, for example
May 14 05:40:58 <miggyb>	so if a new person comes in and they're really active, they're still competing against everyone else who has been here since the beginning
May 14 05:41:02 <derram>	hmmm
May 14 05:41:21 <scriptea>	I say do that.
May 14 05:41:24 <scriptea>	Start over.
May 14 05:41:29 <scriptea>	Fuck everything.
May 14 05:41:31 <derram>	that's how script was. able to move up so fast 
May 14 05:41:38 <scriptea>	Wait, what?
May 14 05:41:49 <scriptea>	I'm not THAT active.
May 14 05:41:53 <derram>	when you switched from steam to irc 
May 14 05:42:02 <scriptea>	Oh, well, that was the 30 day shit.
May 14 05:42:13 <derram>	yeah, because of what miggyb said 
May 14 05:42:21 <Langly>	30 day shit? what the fuck did you eat?
May 14 05:42:22 <scriptea>	Oh, I misread.

May 14 05:43:01 <scriptea>	miggy, I like total stats, can we do yearly stats?
May 14 05:43:17 <derram>	yeah, I say just keep all the old stuff 
May 14 05:43:25 <scriptea>	Cause the other "total stat" chat that I've been in there are monoliths and the plebs.
May 14 05:43:35 <scriptea>	Just a month is too short.
May 14 05:43:39 <derram>	we don't see new people enough to consider that yet 
May 14 05:45:00 <miggyb>	oh shit wait, is it just showing one day?
May 14 05:45:05 <miggyb>	it's definitely not supposed to do that
May 14 05:45:14 <scriptea>	Wha....what?
May 14 05:45:25 <miggyb>	wait no
May 14 05:45:29 <derram>	nah, it's set for a month 
May 14 05:45:38 <miggyb>	http://stats.adery.net/adery.htm is apparently something else
May 14 05:45:54 <Langly>	I once did like 8000 lines in a day on a channel that had stats
May 14 05:46:02 <Langly>	massively skewed the stats that day
May 14 05:46:19 <Langly>	plus lots more lines frome veryone I was talking to too
May 14 05:47:40 <scriptea>	...
May 14 05:47:46 <miggyb>	here we go, i knew there were total stats somewhere: http://stats.adery.net/total.htm
May 14 05:47:52 <miggyb>	i think those should be up to date as well
May 14 05:48:19 <Langly>	I saw oncchannel get its stats completely fucked because of BAD programming once

May 14 05:48:36 <scriptea>	Will making friends with a japanese person increase my chances with japanese women?
May 14 05:48:38 <Langly>	would completely break it
May 14 05:48:43 <Langly>	and merge all the nicks
May 14 05:49:12 <scriptea>	So I'm only HALF of what I used to be? Damn.
May 14 05:49:25 <scriptea>	Same random quote though. :I
May 14 05:49:41 <scriptea>	...which is, um, odd.
May 14 05:49:48 <miggyb>	Langly: it depends on how the logging is done, probably breaks weechat logging
May 14 05:49:56 <miggyb>	but ZNC is more sane, i think
May 14 05:51:44 <Langly>	mIRC quotebots can be fun, put the mirc variable to paste clipboard into a quote
May 14 05:51:44 <scriptea>	Wow, the total stats are interesting.
May 14 05:51:46 <Langly>	call the quote
May 14 05:51:57 <Langly>	bot pastes the machines clipboard into chat
May 14 05:52:27 <scriptea>	I THOUGHT that the daily activity was skewed cause of monthly values, no, it is just truly random.
May 14 05:53:05 <scriptea>	Like, there's a bit of a curve, but really, it's up and down all over the place

May 14 06:00:08 <miggyb>	if anything, i should apologize for disappearing for a while
May 14 06:00:32 <derram>	eeehhhh, stats aren't that important :I 
May 14 06:00:35 <miggyb>	i'll pastebin the current alias list to you. also i found the secret option to track nicks so that should be a little easier now
May 14 06:01:05 <miggyb>	fair enough but, well, part of the problem is i deleted irc from my phone which makes me 90% less likely to respond
May 14 06:01:10 <miggyb>	and setting it up again is unpleasant
May 14 06:04:19 <miggyb>	just re-ran stats if that looks better. i can make it just show the totals if you guys prefer that

May 14 08:41:46 <Booklets>	No plans for a reboot, derram.
May 14 08:42:15 <Booklets>	They'll probably keep the new 52 running while the movies are going
May 14 08:42:33 <Booklets>	Since the costumes are basically designed off the new 52 ones.

May 14 08:48:37 <Augie>	on schools network
May 14 08:48:39 <Books>	comic book history never made sense anyway
May 14 08:48:49 <Books>	no one knew how much time had really passed since any story
May 14 08:48:52 <Books>	it never made sense
May 14 08:48:57 <Books>	in dc or marvel
May 14 08:49:15 <Augie>	they could be in a dimmision that has no rules of time
May 14 08:49:21 <Books>	they're not, though.
May 14 08:49:22 <derram>	unless you're a fan of a specific book 
May 14 08:49:24 <Books>	that exists 
May 14 08:49:34 <Books>	what do you mean?
May 14 08:49:35 <derram>	and then they just wiped out that group's history 
May 14 08:49:46 <derram>	Teen Titans, for instance 
May 14 08:49:56 <Books>	re-read the fucking book, then.
May 14 08:50:06 <derram>	they say there was never a Teen Titans before the new 52 group 
May 14 08:50:13 <derram>	so all that is gone now ;-;
May 14 08:50:26 <Books>	it wouldn' be relevent anyway
May 14 08:50:34 <Books>	it would have zero impact on the current teen titans story
May 14 08:50:40 <Books>	it's completely not important either way
May 14 08:50:55 <Books>	it's just some guy saying "this happened, that didn't happen" to try to make the new story easier to understand
May 14 08:51:07 <Books>	the history wouldn't be relevent to the current ongoing either way
May 14 08:51:29 <Books>	the books weren't burned. if you like the old titans, read that, meanwhile dc has to try to keep things relvent
May 14 08:51:51 <Books>	also, the new 52 teen titans comic got cancelled
May 14 08:51:59 <derram>	hah
May 14 08:52:00 <Books>	and they're re-launching it from #1 with a new roster
May 14 08:52:05 <derram>	how did that happen?
May 14 08:52:13 <Books>	because it sucked and no one liked it
May 14 08:52:32 <Books>	only had one writer the entire run and he one of the worst writers DC has right now
May 14 08:52:52 <Books>	him and some chick who writes Catwoman are so terrible at writing characters, dialouge, and plotlines.
May 14 08:53:17 <Books>	they let him write for Superman for awhile
May 14 08:53:23 <Books>	and they dropped the price in the book by a dollar
May 14 08:53:28 <Books>	just so people would keep buying it
May 14 08:53:46 <Books>	even though Action comics, Detective comics, and the main Batman title were all priced higher
May 14 08:53:48 <derram>	haha
May 14 08:54:00 <Books>	it's really clear how awful he is.
May 14 08:54:04 <Books>	he got teen titans canceled
May 14 08:54:10 <derram>	wow, did all their writers leave or something
May 14 08:54:16 <Books>	but the next comic will have a new writer
May 14 08:54:22 <Books>	they ahve a lot of great, great writers right now
May 14 08:54:41 <Books>	Charles Soule, Scott Snyder, Jeff Lemire
May 14 08:54:48 <Books>	written some of the best comics i've ever read
May 14 08:55:14 <Books>	and all on main titles like Batman, Justice League United, and various other superheroes at the same time
May 14 08:55:21 <Books>	they're all over the place and they're fantastic
May 14 08:55:38 <Books>	it's just that DC's bad stuff gets way more attention than their good stuff
May 14 08:55:53 <Books>	it's more noteworthy to the average person who doesn't read comics
May 14 08:56:14 <Books>	so a lot of people who don't read comics regularly end up just hearing about the negative things
May 14 08:56:50 <derram>	hehe
May 14 08:56:56 <Books>	and then people like Linkara support this mentality. his show just reveiws bad comics, so all his fans hear about is how bad comics can be
May 14 08:56:58 <derram>	like by watching reviews
May 14 08:57:01 <Books>	frustrates me sometimes
May 14 08:57:11 <derram>	he reviews stuff he likes 
May 14 08:57:18 <derram>	just not as often
May 14 08:57:24 <Books>	he just hates so many things. 
May 14 08:57:34 <Books>	yeah, he's mentioned things he's liked before
May 14 08:57:51 <Books>	but the impression most viewers end up getting is how bad things are
May 14 08:58:31 <Books>	there have been some of my favorite moments in comics in the past few months, but it's just not interesting enough to tell people all the time. but if someone fucks up something like the race of a character, then it's interesting to anyone.
May 14 08:58:36 <derram>	he actually did mention that most of his fan don't actually read comics
May 14 08:58:56 <Books>	i assumed as much
May 14 08:59:13 <Books>	he can't realy control his fans, though

May 14 09:01:34 <derram>	oh wait, this isn't the same thing at all
May 14 09:03:15 <Books>	yeah, it's a bunch of examples
May 14 09:03:34 <derram>	well, kid got picked up from home  
May 14 09:03:40 <derram>	most times it happens at school 
May 14 09:03:45 <Books>	it's fucked up
May 14 09:03:50 <Books>	that kind of thing can fuck up a kid
May 14 09:03:59 <Books>	doesn't matter if they're not charged with anything
May 14 09:04:24 <Books>	being handcuffed, dragged away frm everyon you know, and taken to an unfriendly enviroment can fuck up kids

May 14 09:09:18 <Books>	everyone on my reddits is just talking about the new batman outfit
May 14 09:09:28 <derram>	they hate it?
May 14 09:09:33 <Books>	they like it
May 14 09:09:40 <derram>	yeah, he's pretty nice
May 14 09:09:45 <derram>	it's*
May 14 09:09:46 <Books>	it's good
May 14 09:09:48 <Books>	heh.
May 14 09:10:04 <derram>	watching stuffs and touchtyping
May 14 09:10:14 <Books>	sounds like fun.
May 14 09:10:28 <Books>	yeah, the new outfit look like a mix between the new 52 and dark knight returns
May 14 09:10:47 <Books>	big, bold bat symbol, very buff, but the fabric looks out of the new 52
May 14 09:11:08 <Books>	batmobile looks deace.
May 14 09:11:14 <Books>	nothing fancy, nothing too tanky
May 14 09:11:16 <derram>	the new 52 batman is the one that's been in the recent movies, yeah?
May 14 09:11:20 <derram>	cartoon movies*
May 14 09:11:52 <Books>	yes, but the material the costume is made out of doesn't really show through in the animated movies
May 14 09:12:01 <Books>	or even some panels in the comics
May 14 09:12:09 <Books>	http://i.imgur.com/FNvF3dX.png
May 14 09:12:13 <Books>	super detailed costumes.
May 14 09:12:16 <Books>	never look up
May 14 09:12:21 <Books>	good theme.
May 14 09:13:21 <Books>	small ears is good. makes sense, works better with the bolder bat symbol.
May 14 09:13:27 <Books>	imo
May 14 09:13:53 <derram>	hehe, he looks kinda fat 
May 14 09:14:10 <derram>	yeah, I think they should be a bit longer, but it works

May 14 09:14:53 <Books>	yeah, he looks big. just a big guy in a big suit.
May 14 09:15:11 <Books>	not really fat
May 14 09:15:14 <derram>	any word on what the story is gonna be based one?
May 14 09:15:20 <Books>	just not skinny, like how he's often depicted
May 14 09:15:28 <Books>	probably nothing?
May 14 09:15:30 <Books>	like man of steel
May 14 09:15:48 <Books>	and the majority of every comic book movie in the past few years?
May 14 09:16:26 <Books>	especially since they're building their own story in a new way, introducing characters in different orders, it's probably going to be completely original
May 14 09:16:55 <Books>	but live action comic book movies don't really base their stories off comic stories
May 14 09:17:00 <Books>	people need to stop expecting that to happen
May 14 09:17:07 <Books>	at best, they take the name of an arc and the villian.
May 14 09:17:14 <Books>	and that's all they should do
May 14 09:17:28 <Books>	that's what they've been doing and it's obviously been successfull
May 14 09:17:52 <derram>	dunno, I haven't seen many stories with batman and superman 
May 14 09:17:59 <Books>	there are 
May 14 09:18:00 <Books>	so mnay
May 14 09:18:02 <Books>	many
May 14 09:18:08 <Books>	they even have a comic together.
May 14 09:18:13 <Books>	and have had one for years
May 14 09:18:20 <derram>	hehe, yeah I kinda typed that worng 
May 14 09:18:43 <derram>	not many that I've liked, is what should'a said 
May 14 09:19:27 <Books>	there are some good ones. not a lot of origin stories. this is a weird case because it's a Man of Steel sequel, co-starring and introducing Batman.
May 14 09:19:33 <Books>	sequel for superman, first movie for Batman
May 14 09:19:50 <Books>	there isn't a story that would fit this scenerio
May 14 09:20:28 <Books>	it would have to be so loosely based off the story that it would probably be like Age of Ultron, in that they just take the name and bad guy, and re-write everything else
May 14 09:22:35 <Augie>	well gtg bye

May 14 09:23:35 <derram>	luthor was never much of a challenge for batman
May 14 09:24:00 <derram>	esplin, I wouldn't call that a hobo knife
May 14 09:24:04 <Books>	luthor's been a challenge to the entire Justice League before
May 14 09:24:21 <derram>	that would be mean to give to a hobo, cops fucking with them because of their spoon
May 14 09:24:44 <Esplout>	true
May 14 09:24:46 <Books>	When he became president, he was the biggest bad guy of DC for awhile
May 14 09:25:48 <Books>	he can make a good bad guy, is what i'm saying
May 14 09:26:31 <Books>	i think it's a good call
May 14 09:26:58 <Books>	Man of Steel had a villian to match power with Superman, and Luthor will challenge Superman, and Batman, on a different level
May 14 09:27:12 <Esplout>	Man of Steel fucking sucked
May 14 09:27:16 <Books>	it did.
May 14 09:27:18 <derram>	yeah, I was thinking they would go with the president story line
May 14 09:27:31 <Books>	bit early for that. he's supposed to be a younger luthor
May 14 09:27:35 <derram>	but not even being president kept batman away 
May 14 09:27:39 <Books>	i mean, it could still work
May 14 09:27:52 <derram>	when he wanted to talk with luthor, he talked to luthor 
May 14 09:27:59 <Books>	we don't know anything about how this batman works
May 14 09:28:07 <Books>	and he still couldn't stop luthor's plans 
May 14 09:28:20 <derram>	and there's no way they're gonna throw a half batman half superman giant robot in a movie
May 14 09:28:34 <Books>	yer killin' my dreams, derram
May 14 09:28:39 <derram>	hehe
May 14 09:28:57 <derram>	that was seriously goofy as hell, though
May 14 09:29:15 <Books>	too far for this universe, probably
May 14 09:29:39 <Books>	anyway, luthor's a good bad guy for this team roster. i still don't have very high hopes for this movie, but i think that was at least a good call
May 14 09:30:01 *	scriptea (scriptea__@adery-ffd.lmb.njch1j.IP) has left #adery ("Leaving")
May 14 09:30:03 <Books>	villians are important. TDK trilogy was defined by it's villians, each challenging Batman in a new way to keep the stories interesting
May 14 09:31:02 <Books>	i think their choices of villians for those movies were brilliant. Man of Steel had a good idea too, adding more Kyrtonians so that they movie can explain his origin and keep it relevent for the plot of the movie
May 14 09:31:25 <Books>	kind of like how Batman Begins has such a huge them on fear and getting over fear, and used Scarecrow as the villian
May 14 09:31:30 <Books>	the creative choices themselves are good
May 14 09:31:44 <Books>	but i really don't like the director of the Man of Steel movies
May 14 09:32:02 <Books>	so as much as i love DC shit, i'll probably hate these movies.

Aug 16 19:24:04 <zooman>	Metallica sold out really hard
Aug 16 19:24:13 <zooman>	But at least they got out two albums provng they had talent
Aug 16 19:24:51 <wolifeshy>	you have to be one of the only people who thinks the first two are good but not the third
Aug 16 19:25:02 <wolifeshy>	it's a very unusual position
Aug 16 19:25:10 <wolifeshy>	it's usually first 3 or first 4
Aug 16 19:29:16 <zooman>	Theres a definite decline 
Aug 16 19:29:24 <zooman>	They got famous after KTA came out
Aug 16 19:30:03 <zooman>	They started to make more Accessible, friendly music
Aug 16 19:30:09 <zooman>	It didnt really show til ablum 3 tho

Aug 16 19:43:23 <zooman>	I suppose thats too vague though
Aug 16 19:43:31 <RisenLM>	Yeah, that's nonsense and utterly subjective
Aug 16 19:43:52 <wolifeshy>	it's quantifiable 
Aug 16 19:44:09 <RisenLM>	What is the scale of inaccessable music, and how is it rated
Aug 16 19:44:10 <wolifeshy>	harshness of tone, speed, lyrical content
Aug 16 19:44:15 <kat>	pony
Aug 16 19:44:19 <kat>	YES
Aug 16 19:44:38 <wolifeshy>	pony
Aug 16 19:45:02 <zooman>	Chord progression, speed, being played in a different time signature

Aug 16 19:45:25 <wolifeshy>	gj
Aug 16 19:46:01 <zooman>	ll that is quantifiable, but its not relative to accessability in the right way
Aug 16 19:46:13 <zooman>	they dont like line up both going on a sliding cale of 1 to ten
Aug 16 19:46:27 <RisenLM>	Those elements can be quantified, but music isn't just elements

Aug 17 00:58:58 <kwulhu>	;-;
Aug 17 00:59:10 <Artemis>	What about genre music?
Aug 17 01:00:08 <RisenLM>	kwu doesn't like humans' natural compulsion to categorize things because in the case of music it somehow prepetuates unoriginality by creating more in the same vein or something I'm probably projecting
Aug 17 01:00:10 *	Books is now known as Sleeps
Aug 17 01:00:11 <Sleeps>	goodnight
Aug 17 01:01:09 <Echo>	I don't like zooman's obsession with genres
Aug 17 01:01:20 <Artemis>	^
Aug 17 01:01:27 <Artemis>	Yeah I agree on that point
Aug 17 01:01:36 <Echo>	but basic genres are helpful for some things
Aug 17 01:02:01 <Echo>	but you get more specific than a single adjective  and a base genre and it gets retarded fast
Aug 17 01:02:13 <Artemis>	^
Aug 17 01:02:23 <Echo>	post doom metalcore or something retarded like that
Aug 17 01:02:26 <RisenLM>	or really vague adjectives encompassing nondescript swaths of music
Aug 17 01:02:41 <Artemis>	Also he seems to be obessed with finding the newest
Aug 17 01:02:45 <Echo>	^
Aug 17 01:03:15 <Echo>	he'd fit in really well on /mu/ I suppose
Aug 17 01:03:23 <RisenLM>	despite protests to the contrary
Aug 17 01:04:07 <Artemis>	Zach Hill sounds like Free Jazz
Aug 17 01:04:11 <kwulhu>	also
Aug 17 01:04:13 <kwulhu>	I'm back now
Aug 17 01:04:28 <kwulhu>	RisenLM, my problem with genre is that it puts a focus on mood music
Aug 17 01:04:38 <kwulhu>	genre is something that just kind of floats around for a whole song
Aug 17 01:04:55 <kwulhu>	it's like a smell
Aug 17 01:05:19 <Artemis>	Genre like any label should never restrict 
Aug 17 01:05:32 <Artemis>	If it is then youre doing it wrong
Aug 17 01:05:42 <kwulhu>	My problem is not that it's restricting
Aug 17 01:05:52 <kwulhu>	but that it's a distraction
Aug 17 01:06:02 <Artemis>	Not for me really
Aug 17 01:06:08 <kwulhu>	also
Aug 17 01:06:15 <RisenLM>	what from
Aug 17 01:06:20 <Artemis>	I tend not to pay much attention 
Aug 17 01:06:39 <kwulhu>	from pretty much anything that's not stylistic
Aug 17 01:07:11 <RisenLM>	... go on

Aug 17 01:07:15 <BP>	Animated Sheet Music: "Giant Steps" by John Coltrane | 2,661,414 | 99% | 0:04:53
Aug 17 01:07:43 <kwulhu>	if you're thinking about genre, this tune is just bebop
Aug 17 01:07:59 <kwulhu>	it's not even fused with anything!
Aug 17 01:08:32 *	Zoopod has quit (Quit: Colloquy for dicksquid)
Aug 17 01:08:35 <kwulhu>	if you go wtih more stylistic descriptors
Aug 17 01:08:35 <RisenLM>	wouldn't that require welding
Aug 17 01:08:59 <kwulhu>	you could be a fucking dick and say it's technical speed-bebop or some shit like that
Aug 17 01:09:12 <Artemis>	Im not sure what youre talking about Kwulhu
Aug 17 01:09:29 <kwulhu>	let me finish
Aug 17 01:09:34 <kwulhu>	anyway
Aug 17 01:10:30 <kwulhu>	what really makes Giant Steps incredible is Coltrane's creation of natural phrases over changes that are moving through keys major thirds at a time
Aug 17 01:10:59 *	Artemis nods head
Aug 17 01:11:16 <kwulhu>	if you're treating genre like it's something important
Aug 17 01:11:20 <kwulhu>	you're going to miss that
Aug 17 01:11:33 <Artemis>	Im a little lost with the music theory
Aug 17 01:11:42 <Artemis>	But then again I always was
Aug 17 01:12:02 <RisenLM>	I know some of these words
Aug 17 01:12:15 <kwulhu>	genre is something that can be figured out in a few seconds
Aug 17 01:12:26 <kwulhu>	it's the most superficial aspect of music, imo
Aug 17 01:12:39 <Artemis>	I failed out of Pre Algebra and never learned to sight read...
Aug 17 01:12:46 <kwulhu>	;-;
Aug 17 01:12:47 <kwulhu>	well
Aug 17 01:12:49 <Artemis>	but I still played decently.
Aug 17 01:12:52 <kwulhu>	sightreading is tough
Aug 17 01:13:03 <kwulhu>	fucking impossible on guitars ;-;
Aug 17 01:13:21 <RisenLM>	But it exists mostly to find music like whatever X genre is in
Aug 17 01:13:45 <Artemis>	For me its a reference point
Aug 17 01:13:48 <kwulhu>	yeah
Aug 17 01:13:50 <RisenLM>	I don't know that many people aspire to be a genre, save maybe "rock" which is really ambiguous anyway
Aug 17 01:13:51 <kwulhu>	I've heard that
Aug 17 01:13:59 <Artemis>	Like Section A and stuff that starts with "A"
Aug 17 01:14:09 <kwulhu>	You can't deny that there's more than that, though.
Aug 17 01:14:29 <Artemis>	Look
Aug 17 01:14:33 <Artemis>	I dont take this seriously
Aug 17 01:14:35 <RisenLM>	Well that would depend on what more is
Aug 17 01:14:40 <kwulhu>	Electroswing is something totally synthesized with an awareness of genre.
Aug 17 01:14:44 <Artemis>	and people who do are out of it
Aug 17 01:15:10 <Artemis>	This isn't world peace or war. It's genres. Dont get too caught up in it.

Aug 17 01:15:54 <kwulhu>	also
Aug 17 01:15:58 <kwulhu>	I have to be honest
Aug 17 01:17:16 <kwulhu>	part of it is that I feel like there's a bit of showing off in long genre names
Aug 17 01:17:28 <Artemis>	It does get silly
Aug 17 01:17:33 <RisenLM>	Probably, as they're so niche the band gets to decide what it's called
Aug 17 01:17:36 <kwulhu>	it gets silly and boastful
Aug 17 01:17:53 <kwulhu>	especially when the genre name has subjective words like "melodic"
Aug 17 01:17:57 <kwulhu>	hell
Aug 17 01:18:01 <Echo>	Why is cyriak's stuff so oddly terrifying
Aug 17 01:18:02 <Artemis>	I mean if youre mostly a metal band Im goingt to shorten it to metal
Aug 17 01:18:08 <kwulhu>	the most offensive genre name imo is "IDM"
Aug 17 01:18:15 <Artemis>	Oh lord
Aug 17 01:18:17 <Artemis>	IDM
Aug 17 01:18:23 <Artemis>	Fuck that name
Aug 17 01:18:25 <Echo>	IDM?
Aug 17 01:18:30 <kwulhu>	Why don't you just try your best and let the audience decide if it's intelligent, you piece of shit?
Aug 17 01:18:38 <kwulhu>	Intelligent dance music.
Aug 17 01:18:45 <Echo>	heh
Aug 17 01:19:05 <Artemis>	Yeah I think James from Aphex distanced himself from that bullshit name
Aug 17 01:19:13 <kwulhu>	Technical Death Metal is also pretty bullshit
Aug 17 01:19:32 <RisenLM>	That's really pretentious
Aug 17 01:20:05 <kwulhu>	oh
Aug 17 01:20:16 <kwulhu>	there's also Depressive Doom Metal or something like that
Aug 17 01:20:23 <kwulhu>	and Post-Apocalyptic Industrial
Aug 17 01:20:31 <kwulhu>	now
Aug 17 01:20:41 <kwulhu>	I don't believe the labels are actively restricting these bands
Aug 17 01:20:48 <kwulhu>	but when they're so specific
Aug 17 01:20:59 <kwulhu>	it's a good sign that the band just does the same damn song over and over again
Aug 17 01:22:07 <kwulhu>	heh
Aug 17 01:22:12 <kwulhu>	I hate Jazz on headphones
Aug 17 01:22:27 <kwulhu>	way too often the sax is only in one ear
Aug 17 01:22:31 <kwulhu>	well
Aug 17 01:22:42 <Echo>	I hate bands that abuse stereo mixing
Aug 17 01:22:44 <kwulhu>	at least later jazz
Aug 17 01:22:49 *	Echo glares specifically at the beatles
Aug 17 01:22:53 <Artemis>	A lot of Jazz was mono
Aug 17 01:22:54 <kwulhu>	it's gotten a lot better over the years
Aug 17 01:22:59 <kwulhu>	yeah
Aug 17 01:22:59 <Artemis>	and then they split into stereo
Aug 17 01:23:03 <Artemis>	and it fucked it up
Aug 17 01:23:07 <kwulhu>	but I like a lot of stuff from the 60s
Aug 17 01:23:10 <Artemis>	Like The Beatles
Aug 17 01:23:14 <Artemis>	Same deal
Aug 17 01:23:16 <Artemis>	Also

Aug 17 01:23:24 <Artemis>	Old jazz sounds better on vinyl
Aug 17 01:23:28 <Artemis>	IMO
Aug 17 01:23:36 <kwulhu>	I know what you mean
Aug 17 01:23:46 <kwulhu>	but I'm not sure how much of that is the sound
Aug 17 01:23:53 <Artemis>	Its the mixing
Aug 17 01:24:02 <kwulhu>	it's more feeling than sound 
Aug 17 01:24:15 <Artemis>	The fucking idiots remastered the shit for CD and fucked up the dynamic range
Aug 17 01:24:31 <kwulhu>	yeah
Aug 17 01:24:43 <Artemis>	My Miles Davis CD was remastered and it sounds like ass
Aug 17 01:24:51 <kwulhu>	CD has a wider potential dynamic range than vinyl, actually
Aug 17 01:25:15 <kwulhu>	it was just that CD was popular for the loudness war
Aug 17 01:25:24 <Artemis>	True but often these guys doing the mixing thin louder is better
Aug 17 01:25:29 <Echo>	ahh the loudness war
Aug 17 01:25:30 <Echo>	fuckers
Aug 17 01:25:40 <Artemis>	so when they remaster the classic tracks they crank up the volume
Aug 17 01:25:53 <Artemis>	fuckering the dynamic range
Aug 17 01:25:58 <kwulhu>	well yeah
Aug 17 01:26:01 <kwulhu>	it's two steps

Aug 17 03:27:31 <derram>	I have no god damn support outside of the chat
Aug 17 03:27:31 <RisenLM>	Then you're not trying hard enough, because there are billions of other possible things to enjoy, completely unrelated to IRC or a forum
Aug 17 03:27:32 <bitchcakes_s>	find another hobby?
Aug 17 03:27:43 <derram>	maybe if I had some fucking hjelp
Aug 17 03:27:52 <RisenLM>	I can't help you enjoy something else.
Aug 17 03:28:03 <derram>	but I can't even get any of you to browse the fucking sub

Aug 17 03:29:41 <derram>	and guess who told them anything about it
Aug 17 03:29:45 <RisenLM>	Rehashing this for the 82nd time isn't going to improve anything
Aug 17 03:30:10 <derram>	and you staying in there chat after everything they did is killing us

Aug 17 03:45:18 <derram>	but it was worth it because I was making people happy
Aug 17 03:45:30 <derram>	but as soon as I lost that sub, no one cared about my ass anymore
Aug 17 03:45:37 <derram>	because I couldn't give them anything
Aug 17 03:45:52 <derram>	as soon as our chat became less entertaining, they fucking left
Aug 17 03:46:05 <derram>	we were just a stopgap while the mlas1 chat was slow
Aug 17 03:46:35 <derram>	and now I'm sitting here watching it all slowly fall apart while people still argue with me 
Aug 17 03:46:52 <guantanamoskunk>	I think the people who left did so due to drama related discomfort rather than boredom 
Aug 17 03:46:57 <derram>	we have lost over half of our activity, but people still tell me there's nothing wrong
Aug 17 03:47:24 <derram>	that's why swift left, bilb
Aug 17 03:47:29 <bitchcakes_s>	what
Aug 17 03:47:31 <derram>	because our chat is dead every fucking night
Aug 17 03:47:35 <bitchcakes_s>	huh
Aug 17 03:47:47 <bitchcakes_s>	except not?
Aug 17 03:47:51 <derram>	I wasn't a friend, just entertainment
Aug 17 03:47:52 <bitchcakes_s>	i've been in a shitty place lately
Aug 17 03:47:58 <bitchcakes_s>	but if you want me to leave then i will
Aug 17 03:48:08 <derram>	it's been dead every night, swift
Aug 17 03:48:12 <bitchcakes_s>	yeah, sorry?
Aug 17 03:48:19 <bitchcakes_s>	i havent been talking because i havent been talking
Aug 17 03:48:24 <derram>	we've lost all of our night people
Aug 17 03:48:27 <bitchcakes_s>	my life doesnt revovle around the chat
Aug 17 03:48:41 <derram>	and this is summer
Aug 17 03:48:49 <guantanamoskunk>	I got a daytime job, so I can't talk at night 
Aug 17 03:48:51 <derram>	what used to be our busiest time
Aug 17 03:49:04 <derram>	when school starts, we're gonna die completely 
Aug 17 03:49:15 <derram>	I really don't see us making it through to next summer
Aug 17 03:50:05 <guantanamoskunk>	I just want to keep in touch with you guys, regardless of how that goes 
Aug 17 03:51:00 <derram>	all I wanted to do was sit here and enjoy myself 
Aug 17 03:51:11 <bitchcakes_s>	dude i'm sorry
Aug 17 03:51:12 <bitchcakes_s>	whatever
Aug 17 03:51:17 <derram>	but I'm not allowed to have a community, it makes andy uncomfortable
Aug 17 03:51:21 <bitchcakes_s>	actually fuck that, i'm not gonna apologize
Aug 17 03:51:22 <bitchcakes_s>	whatever
Aug 17 03:51:29 <bitchcakes_s>	you want me to leave, i will
Aug 17 03:51:45 <bitchcakes_s>	i dont talk because i dont talk
Aug 17 03:51:47 <bitchcakes_s>	ive been feeling shitty
Aug 17 03:52:00 <guantanamoskunk>	I'm telling you derram, the melodrama isn't helping 
Aug 17 03:52:10 <derram>	no, I want some fucking help in rebuilding the community those mother fuckers destroyed
Aug 17 03:52:12 <guantanamoskunk>	Nobody wants to be around that 
Aug 17 03:52:29 <derram>	well, this is all I can fucking think about, bilb
Aug 17 03:52:42 <derram>	I can't even fucking play games anymore because I keep looking at the dead chat
Aug 17 03:54:14 <derram>	people link mlas1 in comments all the fucking time
Aug 17 03:54:20 <derram>	but no one wanted to link comeinside
Aug 17 03:54:25 <derram>	and no one is linking adery
Aug 17 03:54:53 *	DrinkiePie has quit (Connection closed)
Aug 17 03:54:54 <derram>	what the fuck am I supposed to do when mlas1 keeps telling people to avoid me and no one here ever defends me
Aug 17 03:55:26 <derram>	the people of this chat are the only ones who know the truth over what happened
Aug 17 03:55:35 <derram>	but they never fucking saying anything outside of the chat
Aug 17 03:55:52 <derram>	and I'm just supposed to somehow make a new sub 
Aug 17 03:56:18 *	bitchcakes_s has quit (Quit: Left chat.)
Aug 17 03:57:11 <guantanamoskunk>	I think you should readjust your expectations and be thankful for what you fucking have 
Aug 17 03:57:17 *	guantanamoskunk has quit (Quit: Bye)
Aug 17 03:57:28 <derram>	yeah
Aug 17 03:57:31 <derram>	fuck this
Aug 17 03:58:14 <bitchcakes>	its hard not to be a little ticked when you get extremely oversensitive about it
Aug 17 03:58:22 <bitchcakes>	even kicking jeep when he posted a pic of the sub
Aug 17 03:58:28 <bitchcakes>	showing a joke
Aug 17 03:58:30 <bitchcakes>	jesus christ
Aug 17 03:58:34 <derram>	they have their chat 
Aug 17 03:58:40 <derram>	they can keep their shit over there
Aug 17 03:58:52 <bitchcakes>	dude
Aug 17 03:58:55 <bitchcakes>	kicking someone for a screenie
Aug 17 03:58:57 <bitchcakes>	come
Aug 17 03:58:57 <derram>	Jeep didn't even fucking know about the merger 3 months later
Aug 17 03:58:57 <bitchcakes>	on.
Aug 17 03:59:21 <derram>	swift
Aug 17 03:59:22 <derram>	they 
Aug 17 03:59:24 <derram>	killed
Aug 17 03:59:25 <derram>	my 
Aug 17 03:59:27 <derram>	community
Aug 17 03:59:34 <derram>	because I wouldn't sit in their chat
Aug 17 03:59:47 <derram>	and if they couldn't have it, no one could 
Aug 17 04:00:13 <derram>	and I'm supposed to be happy that I get their active ass sub rubbed in my face?
Aug 17 04:00:34 <derram>	comeinside saw 4-8 posts a day
Aug 17 04:00:44 <derram>	it was almost on the same level as their sub
Aug 17 04:00:54 <derram>	our new sub is lucky to see one post a day
Aug 17 04:01:18 <derram>	and they fucking blamed me for its death
Aug 17 04:01:27 <derram>	"derram abused his power and was removed"
Aug 17 04:01:44 <derram>	when I started that merger to somehow end the fighting
Aug 17 04:02:07 <derram>	now
Aug 17 04:02:19 <derram>	they told me they don't moderate 
Aug 17 04:02:32 <derram>	PMs when esplin was being harrassed by social for sitting in our chat
Aug 17 04:02:42 <derram>	but I got banned for pming loversh a link to our sub
Aug 17 04:02:55 <derram>	and where was anyone to tell them shit about what they did?
Aug 17 04:03:08 <derram>	it's like that every fucking timed
Aug 17 04:03:33 <derram>	I get called a liar for half an hour because I didn't add "when asked" to "I helped people join all three chats"
Aug 17 04:03:58 <derram>	but no one calls andy out when he said "this is the second time derram has been removed from power for abusing it"
Aug 17 04:04:11 <derram>	how am I supposed to do anything
Aug 17 04:04:16 <derram>	no one wants to help
Aug 17 04:04:26 <derram>	our chat is falling apart
Aug 17 04:04:40 <derram>	and it's fucking killing me to sit here and watch it happen every day
Aug 17 04:05:14 <derram>	but no one cares, they just switch tabs

Aug 17 04:07:49 <derram>	also, I bitch like this, what, every 3 weeks
Aug 17 04:08:00 <derram>	when the chat has been sitting dead for an hour already
Aug 17 04:09:56 <derram>	I could get over it if I didn't have to sit and watch it
Aug 17 04:10:06 <derram>	and hope it'll fix itself
Aug 17 04:10:14 <derram>	but it's getting worse and worse
Aug 17 04:10:36 <derram>	and, instead of help, I get arguments
Aug 17 04:10:53 <derram>	we need people posting, upvoting, commenting
Aug 17 04:11:01 <derram>	posting chat screenshots
Aug 17 04:15:54 *	Sleeps is now known as Books
Aug 17 04:16:12 *	derram boops books
Aug 17 04:16:12 <Books>	hey
Aug 17 04:16:23 <Books>	work in an hour
Aug 17 04:16:40 <Books>	stayed up too late
Aug 17 04:16:44 <derram>	can't wait to get home and smoke
Aug 17 04:16:55 <derram>	everything is tolerable when I'm stoned
Aug 17 04:17:05 <Books>	amen
Aug 17 04:18:03 <Books>	also, it is like, super late
Aug 17 04:18:14 <Books>	if there is going to be any time the chat is dead it is now
Aug 17 04:18:20 <derram>	that never mattered before
Aug 17 04:18:35 <derram>	we're going the wrong direction
Aug 17 04:18:49 <derram>	with no way to improve
Aug 17 04:19:34 <derram>	and even you've seen the dead times during the day
Aug 17 04:19:44 <derram>	when we used to be super active 
Aug 17 04:20:27 <Books>	there's nothing new i can tell you
Aug 17 04:22:30 <Books>	it sucks, but there's nothing i can really do
Aug 17 04:23:57 <derram>	post to the sub more
Aug 17 04:24:53 <Books>	i do when i rememer. I don't post anything else on reddit, except for my blog
Aug 17 04:25:01 <Books>	i just don't use reddit as much as i used to
Aug 17 04:27:00 <derram>	upvote links when the bot posts them
Aug 17 04:28:23 <S|-\|_`|`>	but everything that isn't something I link is boooooriiiiing
Aug 17 04:31:24 <derram>	you should upvote things too
Aug 17 04:33:30 <Books>	will do
Aug 17 04:38:07 *	Books is now known as Works
Aug 17 04:38:09 <Works>	bye.
Aug 17 05:15:29 <derram>	every fucking night
Aug 17 05:22:00 <derram>	yeah
Aug 17 05:22:05 <derram>	I can't do this anymore
Aug 17 05:22:33 <derram>	not when I get bitched out for kicking someone when you don't tell them shit for demodding for linking us
Aug 17 05:22:50 <derram>	I'm tired of feeling like this
Aug 17 05:25:29 <loversh>	you can rest your teets
Aug 17 05:25:54 <derram>	no, I can't 
Aug 17 05:26:02 <derram>	because if I'm not here, no one else is
Aug 17 05:26:06 <derram>	and people leave
Aug 17 05:26:12 <derram>	so I have to sit here and watch it
Aug 17 05:26:20 <loversh>	the first part is false
Aug 17 05:26:29 <derram>	it might "just be the internet" to everyone else, but I gave all of the fucks I had
Aug 17 05:26:48 <loversh>	people will be here whether you're here or not

Aug 17 05:27:14 <loversh>	dude chill the fuck out
Aug 17 05:27:26 <derram>	I am stating things that have happened

Aug 17 05:27:59 <loversh>	yes i've read this
Aug 17 05:28:16 <derram>	this community was the only thing I cared about, and it's falling apart
Aug 17 05:28:36 <loversh>	stop saying that
Aug 17 05:28:48 <derram>	I tried just sitting back and not worrying about it when they stole our shit
Aug 17 05:28:57 <derram>	and it's just been a slow decline ever since
Aug 17 05:29:00 <loversh>	that's not true
Aug 17 05:29:05 <derram>	it really is
Aug 17 05:29:07 <loversh>	you didn't sit back 
Aug 17 05:29:20 <loversh>	you tried to be all up in that shit
Aug 17 05:29:20 <derram>	it's been over 5 months, loversh
Aug 17 05:29:26 <loversh>	and they fucked you
Aug 17 05:29:36 <loversh>	yeah, it has
Aug 17 05:29:42 <derram>	I mean after that
Aug 17 05:29:59 <derram>	I tried to just sit here and hope our sub would follow us, but that didn't happen
Aug 17 05:30:05 <loversh>	when the fuck are you going to cool off and let go?
Aug 17 05:30:47 <loversh>	you're having the opposite effect to the one you're trying to achieve
Aug 17 05:31:12 <derram>	at this point I don't really care because it's fucking dying anyway
Aug 17 05:31:19 <loversh>	will you please
Aug 17 05:31:20 <loversh>	calm
Aug 17 05:31:21 <loversh>	the

Aug 17 05:31:59 <loversh>	chillin
Aug 17 05:32:17 <derram>	I'm tired of being alone
Aug 17 05:32:36 <loversh>	man, that's a personal thing not an irc proble,
Aug 17 05:32:39 <loversh>	m
Aug 17 05:32:46 <derram>	well
Aug 17 05:32:53 <loversh>	wait
Aug 17 05:32:55 <derram>	before they stole our shit, I didn't have this problem
Aug 17 05:33:11 <loversh>	don't make your personal problems your irc problems
Aug 17 05:33:31 <derram>	go fucking tell them that
Aug 17 05:33:42 <loversh>	it's a big circle of hate and distress?
Aug 17 05:34:04 <loversh>	you care so much about what ''they'' do 
Aug 17 05:34:14 <derram>	because every time, I get fucked over
Aug 17 05:34:16 <loversh>	SO MUCH
Aug 17 05:34:18 <derram>	and no one tells them shit
Aug 17 05:34:22 <derram>	so what the fuck is next
Aug 17 05:34:24 <loversh>	FUCK them!
Aug 17 05:34:30 <derram>	what are they gonna do next to fuck me over
Aug 17 05:34:32 <loversh>	what is next is up to YOU
Aug 17 05:34:44 <derram>	yeah, just like shutting down my subreddit was
Aug 17 05:34:47 <derram>	oh wait, it wasn't
Aug 17 05:34:54 <derram>	and no one holds them accountable for it
Aug 17 05:35:14 <derram>	it's my fault for trusting herb
Aug 17 05:35:25 <derram>	no one gives half a shit that herb did it because they told him to
Aug 17 05:35:46 <loversh>	so check this out
Aug 17 05:36:02 <loversh>	have you heard of plants?
Aug 17 05:36:03 <derram>	and anything I try to do is flooded by their chat to insult me
Aug 17 05:36:22 <derram>	they're downvoting our sub
Aug 17 05:36:23 <loversh>	derram, do you know what plants do?
Aug 17 05:36:37 <derram>	now tell me, what the fuck have I done to them
Aug 17 05:36:43 <loversh>	shut up 
Aug 17 05:36:44 <derram>	I got up and fucking left
Aug 17 05:36:54 <loversh>	derram: do you know about plants?
Aug 17 05:37:06 <derram>	are you going somewhere with this
Aug 17 05:37:21 <loversh>	yes
Aug 17 05:37:55 <loversh>	flowers get fucked by every intentional and unintentional means in the world
Aug 17 05:38:09 <loversh>	but they still bloom into beautiful creations
Aug 17 05:38:14 <loversh>	every single time
Aug 17 05:38:35 <loversh>	plus they smell pretty fuckin' fine
Aug 17 05:38:39 <derram>	yeah, we bloomed 6 months ago, now we're withering 
Aug 17 05:38:53 <loversh>	so you clipped the main flower 
Aug 17 05:39:04 <loversh>	let the PLANT grow 
Aug 17 05:39:11 <loversh>	there will be more flowers
Aug 17 05:39:14 <derram>	it's not growing
Aug 17 05:39:17 <loversh>	dude
Aug 17 05:39:19 <derram>	that's why I've been pissed
Aug 17 05:39:20 <loversh>	relax
Aug 17 05:39:22 <loversh>	it will grow
Aug 17 05:39:34 <derram>	dude, I've been watching this every day
Aug 17 05:39:40 <loversh>	i'm sure you have
Aug 17 05:39:44 <derram>	it's getting worse all the time
Aug 17 05:39:47 <loversh>	i believe it's not positive 
Aug 17 05:40:06 <loversh>	but all you can do is just hope this shit will grow again
Aug 17 05:40:23 <loversh>	if it doesn't, fine.
Aug 17 05:40:31 <derram>	no, we need people actively trying to help it grow
Aug 17 05:40:55 <derram>	I tried hope, it didn't actually do anything
Aug 17 05:41:25 <loversh>	look 
Aug 17 05:41:32 <loversh>	listen
Aug 17 05:42:14 <loversh>	there is a possibility it won't grow
Aug 17 05:42:20 <loversh>	and you need to be OK with that
Aug 17 05:42:35 <loversh>	for yourself, your sanity
Aug 17 05:42:52 <loversh>	you need to accept that life will fuck you sometimes
Aug 17 05:42:54 <derram>	that's my problem 
Aug 17 05:42:58 <loversh>	and you need to rebound from that
Aug 17 05:43:12 <derram>	it's almost guaranteed to fail
Aug 17 05:43:29 <derram>	there's only a possibility it will grow
Aug 17 05:43:37 <loversh>	it's just a fucking chat room man. you are so much more valuable than this. 
Aug 17 05:43:44 <derram>	not really
Aug 17 05:43:55 <loversh>	convince me that you're not
Aug 17 05:43:55 <derram>	dude, my life has been a massive pile of shit
Aug 17 05:44:09 <loversh>	let's assume i believe in you
Aug 17 05:44:09 <derram>	I can't get a job outside of entry level 
Aug 17 05:44:23 <derram>	I've been watching everyone get better jobs, better lives
Aug 17 05:44:24 <loversh>	convince me that this is all of it
Aug 17 05:44:31 <derram>	but I'm fucking stuck 
Aug 17 05:44:51 <derram>	I hate social interaction and only leave my house to go to work or get food
Aug 17 05:44:55 <loversh>	you're making steady money
Aug 17 05:45:07 <derram>	barely making enough to get by
Aug 17 05:45:12 <loversh>	save $2 a day
Aug 17 05:45:25 <derram>	I have 30 bucks to last me the next 5 days
Aug 17 05:45:41 <loversh>	rice and beans...
Aug 17 05:45:43 <loversh>	noodles... 
Aug 17 05:45:46 <loversh>	that shit sucks
Aug 17 05:45:50 <derram>	I can't even play games anymore 
Aug 17 05:46:07 <loversh>	embrace that
Aug 17 05:46:11 <derram>	this shit made me so happy
Aug 17 05:46:23 <loversh>	yeah but it's gone
Aug 17 05:46:35 <loversh>	you are alive
Aug 17 05:46:40 <loversh>	i'm going to assume you're white
Aug 17 05:46:47 <derram>	nope
Aug 17 05:46:53 <loversh>	you're a fucking white male in the greatest state in our nation
Aug 17 05:47:13 <loversh>	you aren't alive?
Aug 17 05:47:16 <derram>	I'm a mutt
Aug 17 05:47:23 <derram>	dark skinned, big nose
Aug 17 05:47:27 <derram>	big lips
Aug 17 05:47:46 <loversh>	either way dude, you live in the US and you're male
Aug 17 05:47:56 <loversh>	it's not a bad position to be in...
Aug 17 05:48:06 <loversh>	you have a job
Aug 17 05:48:23 <loversh>	you aren't on probation HAHA
Aug 17 05:48:45 <loversh>	in a way i'm jealous of you
Aug 17 05:48:59 <loversh>	i don't give a fuck how many little pony subs you moderated
Aug 17 05:49:04 <derram>	that's because you don't understand the shit I have to go through
Aug 17 05:49:06 <loversh>	i really don't
Aug 17 05:49:24 <loversh>	oh tell me more about how much your communities are being dissolved
Aug 17 05:49:40 <derram>	I can't get a job, or an apartment, or credit, or do anything that requires a background check
Aug 17 05:49:49 <derram>	all without the fun of actually doing something illegal
Aug 17 05:50:35 <derram>	this chat was the only thing I had to give a fuck about

Aug 17 05:51:47 <loversh>	i'm thankful to talk to people that love me

Aug 17 05:52:23 <loversh>	you don't have to trust

Aug 17 05:52:33 <loversh>	just give it all up
Aug 17 05:52:42 <loversh>	try throwing it all away one time
Aug 17 05:52:58 <loversh>	trust in life- trust humanity 
Aug 17 05:53:04 <loversh>	it won't fucking fail you, dude.
Aug 17 05:53:06 <derram>	yeah, no
Aug 17 05:53:25 <derram>	I have been shit on repeatedly by humanity
Aug 17 05:53:55 <loversh>	i'm not naive, derrick. i've been fucked.
Aug 17 05:54:08 <loversh>	but i have learned one thing.
Aug 17 05:54:28 <derram>	did your mom beat the shit out of you while you were >5?
Aug 17 05:54:53 <loversh>	my dad fucked me up with a belt
Aug 17 05:55:04 <loversh>	not just in the ass, but the face too. 
Aug 17 05:55:10 <loversh>	we're not talking about this.
Aug 17 05:55:41 <loversh>	letting go set me free
Aug 17 05:55:53 <loversh>	i think it could do the same for you
Aug 17 05:55:58 <derram>	I was taken away by cps because the neighbors heard me yelling
Aug 17 05:56:03 <derram>	and then suddenly stopped
Aug 17 05:56:12 <derram>	my life has been nothing but shit
Aug 17 05:56:53 <derram>	jumped through foster home after foster home being told that they only cared about the check they got once a month for watching me
Aug 17 05:57:16 <derram>	and I finally found something that I actually gave a fuck about
Aug 17 05:58:08 <loversh>	you live in what i consider to be the best state in the U.S. 
Aug 17 05:58:50 <loversh>	damn i wrote that without seeing the last four messages you wrote
Aug 17 05:59:21 <loversh>	it sounds like you've been through some shit
Aug 17 05:59:46 <loversh>	but it seems like you're a strong person too- with a job. and dogs.
Aug 17 05:59:51 <derram>	humanity only cares about themselves
Aug 17 06:00:46 <loversh>	you have dogs, correct?
Aug 17 06:01:07 <derram>	just the one 
Aug 17 06:01:12 <derram>	other one belongs to my roommate
Aug 17 06:01:40 <derram>	just waiting till I don't have that responsibility anymore
Aug 17 06:04:42 <loversh>	you make me furious
Aug 17 06:04:52 <loversh>	i want to shake you as hard as i can
Aug 17 06:05:05 <loversh>	you can't just give up 
Aug 17 06:05:20 <loversh>	you fool!
Aug 17 06:11:59 <derram>	sub is dead, chat dies all day long
Aug 17 06:12:11 <derram>	I've given up because there's nothing left
Aug 17 06:12:59 <derram>	it's nice that we haven't lost all of our activity, but it's just getting worse and it makes me feel like shit
Aug 17 06:13:14 <loversh>	you're lying
Aug 17 06:13:20 <derram>	I wake up terrified everyday that the chat is gonna be empty
Aug 17 06:14:06 <loversh>	-
Aug 17 06:14:12 <derram>	why would I lie about this
Aug 17 06:14:39 <loversh>	i don't think you're lying, but you are exaggerating things.
Aug 17 06:15:00 <derram>	yeah
Aug 17 06:15:01 <loversh>	i have a hypothetical question for you
Aug 17 06:15:14 <derram>	before the merger, we'd still be pretty busy right now
Aug 17 06:15:17 <loversh>	you wake up 
Aug 17 06:15:36 <loversh>	and somehow all the internet is broken
Aug 17 06:15:52 <loversh>	what do you do?
Aug 17 06:16:20 <derram>	deep breaths and stare at my monitor while I wake up
Aug 17 06:17:02 <loversh>	it isn't coming back.
Aug 17 06:17:03 <derram>	prolly watch something I have downloaded
Aug 17 06:17:15 <loversh>	you are a relatively intelligent man. do you own any books? anything you'd read?
Aug 17 06:17:24 <loversh>	it's an EMP
Aug 17 06:17:27 <loversh>	everything is fried
Aug 17 06:17:38 <derram>	not really
Aug 17 06:17:42 <loversh>	all you have is paper and pen
Aug 17 06:18:14 <derram>	used to draw
Aug 17 06:18:27 <derram>	another thing I gave up to dedicate my life to this place
Aug 17 06:18:56 <loversh>	you don't have to surrender your creativity 
Aug 17 06:20:43 <loversh>	this place isn't healthy for your spirit anyhow
Aug 17 06:21:24 <loversh>	i have an opinion, and let me stress- it's a fucking opinion
Aug 17 06:25:19 <derram>	yeah, just back to where I was before 
Aug 17 06:25:24 <derram>	waiting for the dog to die
Aug 17 06:26:01 <loversh>	i think you are stressed because you're having a hard time stepping back from this chat room. i think you would feel better if you shut your computer off-  let it be off for 24 hours. 
Aug 17 06:26:31 <loversh>	hell, start it now so you can be on tomorrow morning
Aug 17 06:26:41 <derram>	I used to be able to take some time out for myself everyday 
Aug 17 06:26:48 <loversh>	do you think you can't do it?
Aug 17 06:26:54 <derram>	haven't been able to do that since the "merger"
Aug 17 06:26:57 <loversh>	turn it off for a whole day?
Aug 17 06:27:15 <derram>	if I do that, there's no one else here when I'm around
Aug 17 06:27:56 <loversh>	it'll be fine
Aug 17 06:28:03 <derram>	no, it won't
Aug 17 06:28:11 <derram>	it will just be more people leaving like script
Aug 17 06:28:19 <loversh>	that's not true
Aug 17 06:28:34 <derram>	script was one of my longest standing friends
Aug 17 06:28:36 <loversh>	i'm not getting into this
Aug 17 06:28:40 <derram>	3 years
Aug 17 06:29:14 <derram>	our chat had people because the mlas1 chat was always dead
Aug 17 06:29:20 <loversh>	it still is 
Aug 17 06:29:22 <derram>	but now that doesn't apply anymore
Aug 17 06:29:29 <derram>	now our chat is just as dead 
Aug 17 06:29:34 <loversh>	now are you going to try it or not?
Aug 17 06:29:38 <derram>	except they have an active sub to draw in more people 
Aug 17 06:30:36 <loversh>	if anybody needs banned, bitchcakes will take care of it

Aug 17 06:32:13 <loversh>	you have been shutting down everything i have said to you 
Aug 17 06:32:22 <loversh>	and still i'm trying to get my point across
Aug 17 06:32:26 <loversh>	that you matter
Aug 17 06:32:33 <loversh>	that you are valuable
Aug 17 06:32:42 <loversh>	that you deserve some fucking time off
Aug 17 06:32:54 <loversh>	do you at least understand where i am coming from?
Aug 17 06:33:03 <loversh>	please tell me you at least feel my concern for you
Aug 17 06:34:04 <derram>	I know that people care
Aug 17 06:34:09 <derram>	it means a lot
Aug 17 06:34:12 <loversh>	jesus
Aug 17 06:35:17 <derram>	I just worry who's next
Aug 17 06:35:27 <derram>	never thought script would leave until he did
Aug 17 06:37:22 <loversh>	a lot of it is the way you're acting
Aug 17 06:38:13 <loversh>	it has nothing to do with the quality of either chat room- in fact i bet he just plain left
Aug 17 06:39:03 <derram>	did you read the pastebin?
Aug 17 06:39:12 <loversh>	yes
Aug 17 06:39:22 <derram>	I wasn't bitching like this before he left
Aug 17 06:39:53 <derram>	script didn't like drama, so I tried not to bring it up that often
Aug 17 06:39:55 <loversh>	the whole problem was a root

Aug 17 09:54:26 <Augie>	if you get a high end i5

Aug 17 09:59:49 <Lyra>	derram: I have random reddit threads I'm keeping open as reminders (bpm), various stuff I want to look at later, a collection of api documentation pages I was using, some random dA link I like to look at now and then...

Aug 17 10:06:23 <wolifeshy>	computer club computer funded by the college 
Aug 17 10:06:34 <derram>	so he doesn't have to optimize his code
Aug 17 10:06:48 <Augie>	are you doing sfm, while making a game, while playing a game
Aug 17 10:07:01 <Augie>	and browsing reddit
Aug 17 10:07:06 <Augie>	also more tabs
Aug 17 10:07:07 <wolifeshy>	you can have a ton of things open at once 
Aug 17 10:07:16 <wolifeshy>	things happen so instantly on it
Aug 17 10:07:18 <wolifeshy>	no lag ever
Aug 17 10:07:29 <Augie>	it's overkill for a gaming pc
Aug 17 10:07:38 <Augie>	so it me it's useless
Aug 17 10:07:47 <wolifeshy>	hey, they also run Java programming assignments on it!
Aug 17 10:07:55 <wolifeshy>	like Bank Teller Simulator
Aug 17 10:08:01 <wolifeshy>	for the command line
Aug 17 10:08:17 <wolifeshy>	I wonder how long it would take to compile Firefox or something on that
Aug 17 10:08:26 <wolifeshy>	I compiled Firefox once and it took all day
Aug 17 10:09:01 *	Augie gives wolifeshy an amd 295x

Aug 17 10:13:19 <derram>	hehe
Aug 17 10:13:32 <derram>	I would just remember the title for that

Aug 17 10:16:02 <wolifeshy>	unless more have been supported lately
Aug 17 10:16:49 <wolifeshy>	looks like it can go on the Reddit News app

Aug 17 22:46:07 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	So anyway, Augs, my theory is that you'll be exploring other people's personal hells
Aug 17 22:46:42 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	the reason is that P.T. was very focused on a man who murdered his family. It can't be the player character, too big of a plot point to give away so early
Aug 17 22:47:06 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	I think that the level of P.T. was that man's personal hell, and you'll be exploring the hells of other people

Aug 18 23:25:23 <beerpony>	Amazon is not good with this, i've more pics of those rotors on other sites

Aug 18 23:28:15 <Anitech>	I love all of these 30-90 day waranties on rotors.

Aug 18 23:29:29 <beerpony>	but i hear good things about those. argh
Aug 18 23:30:26 <Anitech>	It's not likely they will have an issue.  It's just funny.  The powerStop ones are only 30 days, 90 if it's a daily driver kit.
Aug 18 23:31:30 <beerpony>	can you get the longer exchange windows with the really expensive ones?

Aug 18 23:45:36 <beerpony>	actually i had them checked when i got new tires and they're all about half worn.
Aug 18 23:46:07 <beerpony>	just figured if i got new rotors for the front, why not get some pads?
Aug 18 23:46:16 <Sparx>	Can't I live in Chicago forever? I don't want to go back to Iowa
Aug 18 23:46:35 <beerpony>	if you have a whole lotta money, you can
Aug 18 23:46:52 <beerpony>	especially Chicago
Aug 18 23:47:47 <Anitech>	Just keep in mind the new pads are ceramic and your stocks are probably organic so the gripping force is going to be different.
Aug 18 23:48:31 <beerpony>	hm, well when I asked the dealer he said they were ceramics, but who knows with those guys

Aug 18 23:49:25 <beerpony>	hey, i've seen that one before
Aug 18 23:49:42 <Anitech>	Yeah that's a ripoff.  
Aug 18 23:51:06 <Anitech>	It's been a while since I had rotors resurfaced but I think I paid like $25 for four.
Aug 18 23:51:52 <beerpony>	hm, i'll have to ask around about that.
Aug 18 23:51:59 <beerpony>	even more research! ugh
Aug 18 23:52:50 <Anitech>	It took like 20 minutes.  So unless the guy was planning on doing it by hand...
Aug 18 23:53:09 <beerpony>	i think it's more likely that they have to ship it out for somebody else to do it
Aug 18 23:53:18 <beerpony>	which they count that as part of labor cost
Aug 18 23:53:55 <beerpony>	in which case, i'd rather try out some new rotors, see if i can get some better braking results
Aug 18 23:53:59 <Artemis>	Photoshop ist hard

Aug 19 01:33:14 <Artemis>	People look ugly as sin without a bit of shopping

Aug 19 01:35:07 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	Well, duh art. the argument is that the idea of "ugly as sin without shopping" is bullshit imposed by rampant, well, shopping
Aug 19 01:35:51 <Artemis>	I agree to an extent but shopping a little bit has to be done. No one wants to see inside your pores lol.
Aug 19 01:35:57 <Dr_Chandragupta_M_s>	no one's expecting to see fuckin' Natalie Portman when you drop the filter

Aug 19 13:53:02 <zomir>	Murphy played the majority of the instrumental parts on LCD Soundsystem's albums himself. However when performing live, Murphy often called upon a wide variety of musicians depending on their availability. People who played live with LCD Soundsystem include:
Aug 19 13:53:12 <zomir>	Most of his in studio production was done alone
Aug 19 13:54:05 <zomir>	also i got blood all over my punisher shirt
Aug 19 13:54:10 <zomir>	thats strangely fitting

Aug 19 13:55:46 <Sparkles>	The vigilante? He's no super hero. He's barely a hero.
Aug 19 13:55:57 <zomir>	right
Aug 19 13:56:04 <zomir>	my mind automatically is like
Aug 19 13:56:11 <zomir>	"comic book character = super hero"

Aug 19 14:14:16 <Booooklets>	Not my kind of show
Aug 19 14:15:08 <zomir>	Fair enough
Aug 19 14:15:16 <zomir>	Ive just never heard of someone not getting hooked
Aug 19 14:15:23 <zomir>	If they watch more than two or three episodes
Aug 19 14:15:32 <Booooklets>	Hah.
Aug 19 14:15:32 <zomir>	theyre always like ":i was all hooked and shit, finished it in a week"
Aug 19 14:15:44 <Booooklets>	I also don't like game of thrones
Aug 19 14:16:01 <Booooklets>	Watched a handful of episodes and didn't like it
Aug 19 14:16:34 <zomir>	do you tend to not like live action shizz?
Aug 19 14:16:55 <Booooklets>	Its pretty stupid that you're surprised that someone could not like a show
Aug 19 14:17:05 <Booooklets>	I love live action
Aug 19 14:17:20 <Booooklets>	I don't watch Amy anime, I barely watch any cartoons
Aug 19 14:17:27 <Booooklets>	I mostly watch live action
Aug 19 14:18:13 <zomir>	Nah, not surprised really
Aug 19 14:18:18 <zomir>	Just like
Aug 19 14:18:33 <zomir>	BReaking bad has one of the biggest mass appeals of any show ever made IMO
Aug 19 14:18:40 <zomir>	Its made for frucking everyone 
Aug 19 14:18:44 <zomir>	its sort of absurd 
Aug 19 14:19:09 <Booooklets>	So much boring screentime, though

Aug 19 14:25:02 <Smantick_LFT_CEVO_s>	the books make more sense

Aug 20 07:27:21 <Booklets>	Is it rigged?

Aug 20 07:29:11 <Augie>	well the "game" wants to tackle what real depression is but fails horribly
Aug 20 07:29:26 <Booklets>	The game creator seems shitty, but the game itself doesn't seem like an actual scam
Aug 20 07:29:40 <Booklets>	That doesn't qualify as a scam
Aug 20 07:29:53 <Augie>	well it's not a scam, so i take that back

Oct 13 19:51:15 <AttackTheMoon>	b
Oct 13 19:51:16 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Which makes sense.
Oct 13 19:51:24 <Artemis_Plebious>	"Xbox support said it was the Internet connection"
Oct 13 19:51:25 <AttackTheMoon>	ive had way more fun playing on Xbox than PC
Oct 13 19:51:37 <zoomin>	ATM?
Oct 13 19:51:38 <zoomin>	more like
Oct 13 19:51:41 <zoomin>	attackthecasual
Oct 13 19:51:49 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	You don't want your employees saying "Oh, no I don't use any of the company's products.  I just support them"
Oct 13 19:52:11 <zoomin>	yeah no
Oct 13 19:52:17 <zoomin>	that makes sense
Oct 13 19:52:23 <Artemis_Plebious>	"I dropped my remote into mah beer"
Oct 13 19:52:29 *	zoomin drops art into my dick
Oct 13 19:52:38 *	Echo (flare@echos.location) has joined #adery
Oct 13 19:52:49 <Artemis_Plebious>	These support calls are pretty great
Oct 13 19:53:00 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	I wouldn't have lasted long doing support for Apple if I wasn't good at bullshitting my interested in them.
Oct 13 19:53:08 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	*interest
Oct 13 19:53:08 <Echo>	butts
Oct 13 19:53:16 <zoomin>	hah
Oct 13 19:53:20 <zoomin>	Thats pretty great
Oct 13 19:54:08 <Artemis_Plebious>	I hate our cable tv service
Oct 13 19:54:08 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	"Oh yeah, I'm totally excited for the new MacBok Prose.  Gonne be in line for the release day"
Oct 13 19:54:24 <zoomin>	oh god
Oct 13 19:54:29 <zoomin>	I dont think i could do that
Oct 13 19:54:29 <Artemis_Plebious>	lol right like your pay check can afford a Macbook Pro.
Oct 13 19:54:30 <AttackTheMoon>	i would love apple so much if hte music player wasnt shit
Oct 13 19:54:33 <zoomin>	I would have a stroke
Oct 13 19:54:39 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Zooman, you can do anything if you're paid enough.
Oct 13 19:54:45 <Artemis_Plebious>	^
Oct 13 19:54:47 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Or if your bills are high enough.
Oct 13 19:55:02 <zoomin>	Making minimum wage plus a dollar or two to take calls and tell people how to turn their iphone back on?
Oct 13 19:55:02 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Honestly, I'd take the Apple job back in a heart beat.
Oct 13 19:55:07 <zoomin>	I dont think i could do that
Oct 13 19:55:08 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	It was so fucking easy doing support for them.
Oct 13 19:55:16 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	I did computers. Not iOS.
Oct 13 19:55:32 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Thing is, they get fucked up just like any other computer.
Oct 13 19:55:51 <zoomin>	duh
Oct 13 19:55:56 <zoomin>	"macs dont get viruses"
Oct 13 19:55:59 <zoomin>	thats bullshit
Oct 13 19:56:03 <Artemis_Plebious>	Something I learned about Macs is if they get fucked then it's probably really something horrible.
Oct 13 19:56:04 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	But since the computer is made by the same company as all the software we supported
Oct 13 19:56:24 <zoomin>	as far as i know, its just harder to fuck yourself up like a retard
Oct 13 19:56:26 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	it means that the steps we take for troubleshooting one program is similiar to any other program on teh machine.
Oct 13 19:56:46 <zoomin>	on windows you can click a banner, download some malware garbage, ignore your antivirus telling you its not safe, and boom you have a virus
Oct 13 19:56:52 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Test in a new user to see if it's user specific or system wide, if it's the former, pull the .plists.  If it's the latter, probably have to reinstall it.
Oct 13 19:57:01 <Artemis_Plebious>	If a computer is fucked up I just tell them to contact a computer repair person.
Oct 13 19:57:12 <Artemis_Plebious>	We dont do computer repair
Oct 13 19:57:30 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	If it's multiple programs that are bundled in the OS, then test in safe mode, try recovery, reinstall the OS.
Oct 13 19:57:35 <Artemis_Plebious>	Not worth the trouble.
Oct 13 19:57:56 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Computer won't turn on?  We've got like 1 step before sending you to the apple store.
Oct 13 19:58:04 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Won't get past post, we've got like 6.
Oct 13 19:58:29 <lappycakes>	rm -rf /
Oct 13 19:58:32 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Apple Store was for hardware issues.  Or you could mail it in if it was a macbook
Oct 13 19:58:33 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	OH GOD
Oct 13 19:58:35 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	LAPPYCAKES
Oct 13 19:58:50 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Sometimes, the trash doesn't let you empty it.
Oct 13 19:58:51 <lappycakes>	best troubleshooting
Oct 13 19:58:52 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Like, at all.
Oct 13 19:58:56 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	To fix this
Oct 13 19:59:10 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	you go into the command line and type in the command to enter the trash.
Oct 13 19:59:20 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	If you put an extra space in the wrong spot, it wipes your hard drive.
Oct 13 19:59:27 <zoomin>	lappycakes, wanna buy a box of memes?
Oct 13 19:59:29 <Artemis_Plebious>	I hate working with Macs on support. 
Oct 13 19:59:33 <lappycakes>	theres no way that could go wrongs at all :D
Oct 13 19:59:39 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Oh it did.
Oct 13 19:59:43 <lappycakes>	i refuse to help friends with command line support
Oct 13 19:59:44 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Not to me
Oct 13 19:59:48 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	but I watched it happen.
Oct 13 19:59:52 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	They were screensharing.
Oct 13 20:00:00 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	With another agent.
Oct 13 20:00:01 <Artemis_Plebious>	Windows 8 is pretty horrible though.
Oct 13 20:00:11 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	The icons on the Cx's machine were disappearing one by one.
Oct 13 20:00:12 <Augie>	8.1 is fine tho, Artemis_Plebious 
Oct 13 20:00:16 <Artemis_Plebious>	Because they basically want me to teach them how to use that shit
Oct 13 20:00:18 <lappycakes>	hahahahah
Oct 13 20:00:22 <lappycakes>	and they didnt do anything?
Oct 13 20:00:24 <Artemis_Plebious>	Because it dumps them to the fucking TILES
Oct 13 20:00:24 <lappycakes>	no crtl c?
Oct 13 20:00:27 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	You can't.
Oct 13 20:00:30 <lappycakes>	dude wha
Oct 13 20:00:34 <Augie>	ill crtl ur c
Oct 13 20:00:35 <lappycakes>	you can stop that shit with ctrl c
Oct 13 20:00:42 <Artemis_Plebious>	and those old people have a fucking heart attack
Oct 13 20:00:51 <lappycakes>	dude
Oct 13 20:00:56 <lappycakes>	you havent used a surface, art
Oct 13 20:00:57 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Lappy, once it starts wiping the hard drive, you can't really get it back.  Even if you stop it half-way through.
Oct 13 20:00:58 <lappycakes>	tiles like
Oct 13 20:00:59 <lappycakes>	MAKE SENSE
Oct 13 20:01:04 <Artemis_Plebious>	lappycakes
Oct 13 20:01:05 <lappycakes>	well yeah
Oct 13 20:01:09 <lappycakes>	but you can stop it to minimize damage
Oct 13 20:01:11 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Unless you've got a backup.
Oct 13 20:01:14 <Artemis_Plebious>	those old people have holes in their brain
Oct 13 20:01:16 <lappycakes>	dont they make you do a backup before it?
Oct 13 20:01:23 <Artemis_Plebious>	They cant handle those tiles.
Oct 13 20:01:27 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Not everyone has access to an external.
Oct 13 20:01:39 <lappycakes>	isnt there like
Oct 13 20:01:43 <lappycakes>	system restore points
Oct 13 20:01:48 <Artemis_Plebious>	Those goddamn tiles are the bane of my existence in support.
Oct 13 20:01:49 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	And doing a backup would be cumbersome for a simple trash can wipe.
Oct 13 20:01:52 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Nope.
Oct 13 20:01:58 <lappycakes>	and the agent like
Oct 13 20:02:01 <lappycakes>	atching the computer
Oct 13 20:02:02 <lappycakes>	didnt see it?
Oct 13 20:02:13 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	I guess not.
Oct 13 20:02:16 <lappycakes>	lmao
Oct 13 20:02:20 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	Single space isn't hard to miss.
Oct 13 20:02:27 <lappycakes>	could be a small claims court thing
Oct 13 20:02:31 <lappycakes>	possibly
Oct 13 20:02:36 <Princess_Twi`Naga_s>	But when I had them on screenshare, typing in a command, I'd check and triple check.
