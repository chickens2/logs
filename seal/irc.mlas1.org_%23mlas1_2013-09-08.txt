18:36:25: <EvilHom3r> hey
18:36:38: <cheesemoo> um
18:37:27: <cheesemoo> Loom is a graphical adventure game originally released in 1990. It was both developed and published by Lucasfilm Games (later called LucasArts) and was the fourth game to use the SCUMM adventure game engine. The project was led by Brian Moriarty, a former Infocom employee and author of the classic text adventures Wishbringer (1985), Trinity (1986) and Beyond Zork (1987).
18:36:35: <EvilHom3r> tell me about Loom‚Ñ¢
18:37:05: <cheesemoo> i was more referencing a joke from monkey island
18:37:12: <EvilHom3r> this is false advertising

18:37:47: EvilHom3r plays with cheesemoo's loom
18:37:21: <cheesemoo> ~g Loom game
18:37:51: <cheesemoo> A departure from other LucasArts adventure games in many senses, Loom is based on a serious and complex fantasy story. With its experimental interface, it eschewed the traditional paradigm of graphical adventures, where puzzles usually involve interactions between the game character, the environment, and multiple items the character can take into their possession.
18:37:51: <cheesemoo> Loom's gameplay centers instead around magical four-note tunes (drafts) that the protagonist, Bobbin Threadbare, can play on his distaff. Each draft is a spell that has an effect of a certain type, such as "Opening" or "Night Vision". Drafts can be learned by observing an object that possess the qualities of the relevant draft; for example, examining a blade while it is being sharpened gives the player the "Sharpening" draft.
18:37:51: <cheesemoo> Some drafts can be reversed by playing their notes backwards, so the "Dye" draft played backwards becomes "Bleach", while others, such as the "Terror" draft, are palindromes and can not be reversed in this manner. The player's abilities increase over the course of the game, with more and more powerful drafts. At first, only the notes C, D and E are playable, but by the end of the game F, G, A, B, and high C' are also available.
18:37:51: <cheesemoo> Loom was also the first game to follow the LucasArts Game Design Philosophy, which states that the player will never be killed or forced to restart the game and won't have to "spend hours typing in synonyms until [they] stumble on the computer's word for a certain object" (see guess-the-verb).
18:37:51: <cheesemoo> The game can be played at three difficulty levels, each with slightly different hints. For example, the "Expert" level does not mark the distaff and is played solely by ear. In the original version, the expert player is rewarded with a graphic sequence that does not appear in the two other levels. The DOS CD-ROM version, however, shows a much shorter version of this sequence to all players.
