08:00:42: <loversh> i had a friend from pit that is now a professional percussionist
08:00:49: <PubliqPhirm> that's pretty baller
08:00:53: <loversh> he's gay
08:00:07: <PubliqPhirm> The one nice thing about rack was playing the bass drum and gong at the same time, also Ã§alled hitting the bong
08:00:43: <PubliqPhirm> Aimaichi's pit used them in their show
08:00:56: <loversh> and amazing
08:01:14: <loversh> but mostly gay
08:01:31: <loversh> and when i mean gay
08:02:32: <PubliqPhirm> he seriously thinks they're useless bags of flesh for no reason
08:01:48: <loversh> i mean this man is completely repulsed by vaginas
08:02:51: <loversh> there's always a reason
08:03:03: <loversh> some boob related incident
08:02:10: <PubliqPhirm> sounds like one of my friends.  he can't understand why people like boobs
08:03:13: <loversh> wasn't breast fed
08:03:37: <loversh> honestly, some of those huge tits are fuckin scary
08:03:20: <loversh> psychology
08:03:55: <loversh> who wants a balloon of pelicans and marbles
08:04:07: <loversh> i'd rather anything tight and firm
08:04:15: <loversh> than pelicans
08:04:56: <PubliqPhirm> I used to be the opposite way, then I met my girlfriend.
08:05:07: <loversh> i'm so sorry
08:05:36: <PubliqPhirm> Huge boobs usually mean a huge woman to support them, much like Wagnerian opera needed large actresses to project their voices over his pit orchestras
08:06:08: <PubliqPhirm> Now, I've admitted to myself that small+skinny women are well worth it for the smaller breasts
