02:28:07: <memetic> Man going through my most controversial posts
02:29:14: <jeep8790> My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as 
02:28:13: <memetic> I was pretty dumb sometimes
02:29:02: <seal> WHOO COMMIEFORNIA
02:29:13: <jeep8790> It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know.
02:29:13: <jeep8790> That said.
02:29:13: <jeep8790> In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.
02:29:13: <jeep8790> An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.
02:29:21: <jeep8790> good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.
02:29:23: <jeep8790> I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powe
02:29:28: <jeep8790> rful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).
02:29:30: <jeep8790> I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.

02:30:05: <jeep8790> I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.
02:30:09: <jeep8790> I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight

02:29:56: <jeep8790> I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I do

I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.

02:29:45: <jeep8790> I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your pres

02:30:24: <jeep8790> I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit "women are crazy"

04:00:33: <EvilHom3r> ~ud abomination
04:00:34: <RariBot> A creature so horrible that if you look at it for to long, your eyes will start to bleed. Lives in drainpipes and grease pits surrounding high schools and universities. The origins of the abomination goes something like this: a giant plague infested sewer rat rapes an AIDS carrying orangutan, in the ass, while in the restroom of a 747. The orangutan proceeds to shit out the ass baby that was conceived. The baby abomination  gets ejected out of the plane 
04:00:58: <EvilHom3r> sounds about right

07:18:12: <Fegelein> Oh.
07:17:06: <Fegelein> gas it
07:17:28: <EvilHom3r> yeah
07:18:02: <seal> I was thinking of chambering a round in a gun
07:18:18: <seal> lol
07:17:32: <EvilHom3r> you don't just jump straight to gassing
07:17:43: <EvilHom3r> you have to torture them a bit
07:19:49: <Fegelein> Ha ha, my mistake. Didn't really get what you were trying to say, I guess.
07:21:16: <Fegelein> "Can you swim?"
07:21:49: <seal> having a nick like Seal and being unable to swim IRL would just be embarassing
07:21:50: <seal> actually
07:21:19: <seal> yes
07:21:57: <seal> being unable to swim IRL would just be embarassing*
07:21:05: Fegelein throws Seal back in the ocean.
07:21:23: seal floats
07:23:45: <Fegelein> Yeah. It's not that hard to stay afloat.
07:22:41: <Fegelein> Yeah. That would suck.
07:23:02: <seal> you're like 80% water anyways
07:23:08: <seal> and your lungs are just big sacs of air
07:22:52: <seal> I don't get how people are unable to swim
07:22:53: <seal> I mean
07:24:50: <Fegelein> * in still water.
07:26:27: <Fegelein> So you might want to think twice.
07:26:13: <Fegelein> But still. I hear the oceans have high quantities of naturally occuring Dihydrogen Monoxide.
07:26:32: <seal> oh shit
07:26:35: <seal> I heard that
07:26:41: <seal> if you mix that stuff with Lithium
07:26:43: <seal> it fucking explodes
07:27:49: <Fegelein> Yeah. Cesium too. Dangerous stuff.
07:28:25: Working_Pwny licks seal
07:28:28: <Fegelein> I heard one of the main components of the chemical caused the Hindenburg to blow up.
07:28:49: <seal> dude
07:29:13: <EvilHom3r> did you know
07:29:22: <EvilHom3r> that the vast majority of american homes
07:28:55: <seal> I heard that like
07:29:28: <Fegelein> sorry
07:29:29: <EvilHom3r> have dihydrogen monoxide in their tap water
07:29:36: <EvilHom3r> it's a conspiracy man
07:28:45: <seal> oh man

07:33:59: <seal> ewwwww
07:32:42: seal dives into pool of gasoline
07:33:00: <EvilHom3r> dihydrogen monoxide is often added to commercial gasoline as a filler chemical
07:33:28: <seal> welp
07:33:42: seal would shoot self but flippers
07:33:44: <seal> ;_;

08:14:59: <Working_Pwny> ~ud magnet
08:14:58: <seal> haha
08:15:03: <seal> I think my dog sleeps with his eyes open
08:15:01: <RariBot> A fucking magnet is an object or material that creates a motherfucking magnetic field and shit. Magnets are miracles and no one knows how they work, though scientists have created many lies to explain the laws of electro-motherfucking-magnetism.
