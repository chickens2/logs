01:05:15: <tortuga> Hey guys, I have a quick question. How would one go about posting a fursuit porn video colection online?
01:05:42: <tortuga> Youtube obviously isn't an option
01:06:03: <tortuga> puush isn't working
01:06:31: <tortuga> mega.co.nz maybe?
01:08:01: <EvilHom3r> xtube
01:08:31: <seal> that's where all of the most horrifying videos on the internet are - why not help become more horrifying?
01:08:10: <EvilHom3r> ychan
01:08:10: <seal> liveleak

01:19:26: <memetic> I emailed GabeN about it and he confirmed
01:18:43: <zooMan> Why is tekkit redownloading
01:18:47: <zooMan> tell me plz
01:19:09: <memetic> Because it's converting to SteamOS

01:22:06: <memetic> What if it's actually the release of The Marshall Mathers LP 2

01:22:56: <zooMan> TFW the marshall mathers LP 2 isnt going to be any different from eminems "new" sound
01:23:06: <zooMan> Which is just, yknow, generic boring rap
01:23:44: <zooMan> what happened
01:23:41: <zooMan> His music used to be so awesome
01:25:42: <memetic> I liked Recovery
01:26:26: <memetic> I actually don't know about this one
01:27:20: <memetic> Well, except for the nasally Slim voice, that's gone
01:27:29: <zooMan> Really?
01:27:04: <memetic> The fact that he's naming it after one of his greatest albums makes me think he's trying to get back to that style
01:27:42: <zooMan> I didnt like anything past the eminem show

01:29:17: <memetic> Quality definitely took a nosedive after The Eminem Show, but some of Encore is redeemable
01:29:34: <memetic> Not to mention When I'm Gone is probably my favorite Eminem song
01:30:02: <memetic> Nope, it's a single from Curtain Call
01:29:49: <zooMan> Which is from encore, yes?
01:30:36: <zooMan> OH
01:30:42: <zooMan> I knew that
01:30:50: <EvilHom3r> you new that
01:34:47: <memetic> I definitely think that Eminem Show is and will be his peak
01:34:58: <zooMan> For sure

01:46:41: <tortuga> "and the customers were all like, "This is the Wal*Mart, There aint supposed to be dogs in here!""
01:46:52: <tortuga> "and then I would walk away and them immediately he wold run down the aisle ad scare the shit outta them"

02:02:39: <EvilHom3r> no
02:02:45: <EvilHom3r> they're too shitty
02:10:17: <memetic> But
02:10:44: <EvilHom3r> choo choo
02:10:22: <memetic> The truck have started to move
02:11:35: <memetic> 3 people who primarily are on ComeInside?
02:11:39: <EwanMacIan> uh
02:11:43: <memetic> That sure would be interesting
02:12:13: <EwanMacIan> also jero isn't in chat that often
02:12:27: <RisenLM> The mysterious Andy-train
02:12:35: <RisenLM> Not too keen on the lack of transparency myself
02:11:18: <theclinger> So the new mods are Ewan, Jero, and Swift right?
02:12:31: <theclinger> he was fairly often before "the event".
02:12:17: <RisenLM> Sub mods
02:11:56: <EwanMacIan> that was a joke, right?
02:13:03: <RisenLM> Maybe he did, but it's your alter-ego?
02:13:10: <tortuga> it was nice
02:13:00: <theclinger> I live in the same timezone and am not that active.
02:13:01: <tortuga> wow
02:13:41: <EwanMacIan> I was talking to whoever said I'm a mod
02:13:46: <memetic> ok

02:12:49: <theclinger> I'm just buthurt he didn't choose me.
02:12:56: <tortuga> i just watched a video of spiderman fucking a wolf
02:13:06: <memetic> Wait ewan were you talking to me?
02:13:46: <theclinger> My name is Andrew, so Andre would be my alter ego.
02:16:15: <memetic> What if Valve's Friday announcement is the three new mods
02:17:58: <memetic> Nah
02:18:02: <RisenLM> They patented a modular thing where you can swap out/positions of DPads, analog sticks, 4button configs, and even a trackball.
02:17:38: <RisenLM> It's the controller.
02:18:10: <RisenLM> *
02:18:26: <memetic> It's actually Paperboy Remastered
02:18:04: <memetic> It's clearly Deadly Premonition 2
02:18:08: <RisenLM> Richochet 2
02:20:54: <memetic> It's actually Valve's acquisition of Nintendo
02:22:01: <memetic> It's actually a reveal that the whole thing is really just the Ouya
02:22:51: <EvilHom3r> it's actually cocks
02:23:01: <EvilHom3r> just like Lord_Ninka
02:23:20: EvilHom3r tips his dildo

02:27:42: <EvilHom3r> submit pony fics as your essays
02:28:20: <loversh> teacher posts it to /cringe, get my shit posted on reddit

02:32:42: <theclinger> hue
02:32:46: <seal> the fuck you want, loversh 
02:32:39: <jeep8790> heh
02:32:42: <memetic> That was pretty clever
02:33:03: <memetic> Retarded and pointless, but clever
02:33:32: <loversh> even better Memetic, take the end of a FiM episode
02:33:37: <loversh> and use it as your thesis
02:33:09: loversh licks everybody
02:34:15: <EvilHom3r> pwny pls
02:34:36: <loversh> Memetic: http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Friendship_lessons
02:35:24: <loversh> "I learned that no matter where you go in life, you should never forget that you are the product of your home and your friends. And that is something always to be proud of, no matter what. " 
02:36:05: <theclinger> Too bad loversh.  I am either not very good at college level english, or not willing to put more time in than is required, but my schools classes were always pretty easily passible.
02:36:29: <memetic> I need to think about this
02:35:51: <loversh> A+ college application essay right there
02:36:15: <memetic> Holy shit
02:36:22: <memetic> I wanted to give a rebuttal but
02:36:25: <memetic> Damn
02:36:39: <theclinger> Give back to dah hood Meme.
02:37:10: <RisenLM> oh, application essay
02:37:22: <RisenLM> I thought you meant it was a college writing class.
02:38:08: <loversh> not finishing work
02:38:27: <loversh> and go back to it, and rearrange the words
02:38:03: <theclinger> Are you not finishing the work, or just getting really bad marks?
02:38:14: <loversh> i have really bad ADHD 
02:37:30: <loversh> mine is
02:37:41: <loversh> probably the fourth time i've taken eng111... i justl.. can't write on command like that
02:38:18: <loversh> so i'l take a sentence like this
02:38:34: <loversh> for 30 minutes
02:39:47: <loversh> so nothing gets done and i give up, i'll walk away telling myself to come back and finish it, but never do
02:39:58: <loversh> :/
02:40:35: <theclinger> Just don't delete the paragraph.  It may suck, but it's passing the class that you care about, not having exceptional work.
02:38:59: <loversh> and an hour later i have a paragraph and i'm like "FUCK THAT'S A TERRIBLE PARAGRAPH BETTER DJUST DELETE IT AND START FROM SCRATCH''
02:40:03: <theclinger> I have a hard time focusing on stuff like writing (I'm not diagnosed with anything) but I basically  spent the entire day after school the day before it was due writing the essay, no matter how long it took.
02:41:04: <loversh> the problem is that exceptional work is what i care about.....
02:41:33: <loversh> to the point where it's disabling
02:42:43: <theclinger> I felt really bad for most of the essays I turned in for my classes, and never wrote more than one draft, but the definition of good work I gave myself was at bare minimum completing my assignments on time.
02:43:08: <theclinger> Honestly you need to complete a few drafts in the best case anyway, leave that horrid first draft for just in case.
02:44:04: <loversh> theclinger <3
02:44:04: <theclinger> OH SHIT IT'S SPEEDY
02:44:07: <speedy> in english clash

02:43:50: <speedy> I only turned in one essay in high school

02:46:22: <theclinger> Or at least "fun".
02:45:29: <theclinger> My name is Andrew.
02:45:59: <speedy> had a really eventful trip
02:46:33: <theclinger> (where 'fun' is doing productive stuff)
02:46:03: <theclinger> I figured.
02:47:38: <speedy> Well I had sex so thats something
02:47:47: <speedy> also went to an aquarium and a few parties
02:48:10: <EvilHom3r> did you have sex in the aquarium

03:01:34: <seal> oh my god
03:02:06: <seal> they're all so fucking mad about some random guy insulting their native language
03:02:15: <seal> "This is the most inane, most racist, most baseless pile of shit disguised as a half-readable quasi-empirical article I have ever seen. Did you also swallow the eugenics movements' faux science? Or social Darwinism? Do you even understand the cultures of any of these languages you list? THIS MAN IS A FAKE, REAL LINGUISTS DO NOT BELIEVE THIS BULLSHIT."
03:02:17: <RisenLM> People get defensive.
03:02:34: <seal> ya know
03:02:33: <seal> I understand that, but comparing insulting languages to eugenics is kinda
03:01:47: <seal> \the people in the comments of this article
03:03:04: <DrinkiePie> did I get pinged
03:01:50: <memetic> tfw you have Dr. Wiley's theme playing in your head 24/7
03:02:56: <memetic> Well, it's easy to insult someone's culture by insulting their language
03:03:18: <seal> I know that, it just seems like a major overreaction
03:03:19: <memetic> I'd have to see what they're reacting to, but it's entirely possible they stepped over the line
03:04:33: <memetic> "Handy, but it�s still Asian and sounds like all the other ones."
03:03:30: <seal> http://takimag.com/article/the_best_and_worst_languages_in_the_world/print
03:03:50: <seal> I'll admit, I'm biased towards english, but what the guy wrote was only mildly insulting at worst
03:06:17: <seal> yea, I wouldn't be too offended if someone said that about english
03:05:05: <memetic> "No wonder Chinese workers barely ever come home.
03:05:06: <memetic> "
03:05:37: <memetic> "
03:05:37: <memetic> "my ears bleed every time an Israeli or an Arab speaks.
03:07:06: <seal> :P
03:06:50: <loversh> you gotta imagine to some people, "Y'ALL HURRY UP NAW Y'HEAR" has to be torture
03:07:10: loversh glares at Seal *
03:08:38: <memetic> The one you posted is certainly exaggerating
03:07:02: <seal> it's torture to me too
03:07:15: <memetic> It's a bit different when your language is one of the most commonly-spoken one in the world
03:07:57: <seal> the comments on that article just seem way over the top to me
03:07:28: <memetic> ones*
03:07:29: <seal> true, true
03:10:38: <memetic> Also, fuck that website and its stupid fucking copy&paste shit
03:09:01: <memetic> But it is inane, racist, and bullshit
03:26:35: <loversh> wtf man
03:26:29: <loversh> holy shit i just read that article
03:26:38: <loversh> wtf.
03:28:42: <memetic> it's not great
03:28:09: <seal> it's just some guy being an idiot
03:30:40: <memetic> Risen, remember when you said how I could never catch up with TBFP?
03:31:13: <RisenLM> Not without having an excess of free time and maybe abandoning some of it.
03:32:34: <memetic> I've been covering like 3-4 days every day
03:31:11: <memetic> RisenLM
03:32:06: <memetic> Well, exactly
03:32:48: <memetic> Certain people would label it an addiction
03:34:02: <memetic> I'm almost definitely making progress, though. It helps to use real-life events to figure out how far away I am.
03:34:33: <memetic> For instance, I'm a few days past the XBone reveal
03:35:10: <RisenLM> So June?
03:35:26: <memetic> Pretty much
03:52:50: <reddit> http://redd.it/1n5gw4 > [theclinger_4] I blame Coggy.
03:55:18: <seal> so I discovered something mildly interesting
03:55:45: <seal> my omeprazole that I have to take is in the form of little pellets inside of the capsule, rather than powder
03:56:10: <blobalewie> Pwny 
03:56:14: <RisenLM> That's not uncommon
03:56:49: <derram> Working_Pwny 
03:56:50: <seal> I'd imagine it's not
03:57:10: <derram> Pwny 
03:57:09: <seal> just seems like things would be powder instead of little pellets
03:57:11: <Working_Pwny> Fuck
03:58:39: <derram> Working_Pwny 
03:58:48: seal licks Working_Pwny
